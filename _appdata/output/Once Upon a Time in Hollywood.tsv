	This man is worth $500,	23	0	00:00:41a
	and this man's going to collect.	32	1	00:00:41b
	He's Jake Cahill, and he lives by...	36	2	00:00:44a
	Bounty Law.	11	3	00:00:46a
	You don't ever bring them in alive, do you, Jake?	49	4	00:00:49a
	Not when there's three of them and one of me.	45	5	00:00:57a
	What are you looking at, bounty killer?	39	6	00:00:58a
	I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot about to get his jaw busted.	60	7	00:01:02a
	Amateurs try and take men in alive.	35	8	00:01:07a
	Amateurs usually don't make it.	31	9	00:01:09a
	Whether you're dead or alive,	29	10	00:01:14a
	you're just a dollar sign to Jake Cahill on Bounty Law.	55	11	00:01:14b
	Thursdays at 8.30, only on NBC.	31	12	00:01:22a
	Hello, everybody.	17	13	00:01:23a
	This is Allen Kincade on the set of the exciting hit NBC and Screen Gems television series Bounty Law.	102	14	00:01:28a
	Now, if you think you're seeing double,	39	15	00:01:34a
	don't adjust your television sets because,	42	16	00:01:34b
	in a way, you are.	18	17	00:01:34c
	To my right is Bounty Law series lead and Jake Cahill himself,	62	18	00:01:38a
	And to my left is Rick's stunt double,	38	19	00:01:41a
	Welcome and thanks for taking the time to visit with us.	56	20	00:01:43a
	It's our pleasure, Allen.	25	21	00:01:46a
	So, Rick, explain to the audience exactly what it is a stunt double does.	73	22	00:01:53a
	actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff.	51	23	00:01:56a
	Say Jake Cahill gets shot off his horse.	40	24	00:01:59a
	Now, can I fall off a horse?	28	25	00:02:01a
	Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.	29	26	00:02:07a
	But say I fall off wrong and I sprain my wrist or I...	54	27	00:02:10a
	or I twist my ankle.	20	28	00:02:12a
	Now, that can put an undue burden on production because now maybe I can't work for a week.	90	29	00:02:17a
	So Cliff here is meant to help carry the load.	46	30	00:02:20a
	Is that how you'd describe your job, Cliff?	43	31	00:02:22a
	What, carrying his load?	24	32	00:02:22b
	Yeah, that's about right.	25	33	00:02:30a
	Join me next week on the set of	31	34	00:02:30b
	The Dick Van Dyke Show,	23	35	00:02:36a
	where I'll be talking to comical cutups,	40	36	00:02:36b
	Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.	31	37	00:02:36c
	Till then, this is Allen Kincade signing off from Hollywood.	60	38	00:03:56a
	Hi.	03	39	00:03:56b
	I missed you.	13	40	00:04:02a
	The black one.	14	41	00:04:02b
	And the flowers.	16	42	00:04:04a
	Flowers, Ava, flowers.	22	43	00:04:06a
	And there's the small one.	26	44	00:04:07a
	Can I see your tickets?	23	45	00:04:09a
	Good boy.	09	46	00:05:11a
	Gina, Gina, Gina.	17	47	00:05:13a
	The face in the misty light.	28	48	00:05:15a
	Hello, Mr. Schwarz.	19	49	00:05:15b
	Hello, Gina.	12	50	00:05:18a
	I, uh...	08	51	00:05:18b
	I have a meeting with a very handsome cowboy man.	49	52	00:05:22a
	He's waiting for you in the bar.	32	53	00:05:25a
	Ah.	03	54	00:05:28a
	since I just finished watching a Rick Dalton fucking film festival,	67	55	00:05:32a
	I think I know who you are.	27	56	00:05:32b
	Put it there.	13	57	00:05:35a
	Well, it's my pleasure, Mr. Schwartz.	37	58	00:05:37a
	And thank you for taking an interest.	37	59	00:05:39a
	Schwarz, not Schwartz.	22	60	00:05:41a
	G-goddamn it to hell.	21	61	00:05:41b
	I'm-I'm sorry about that.	25	62	00:05:44a
	It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.	30	63	00:05:44b
	Call me Marvin.	15	64	00:05:47a
	Marvin, call me Rick.	21	65	00:05:49a
	Rick?	05	66	00:05:49b
	Yeah.	05	67	00:05:50a
	Is that your son?	17	68	00:05:50b
	My son?	07	69	00:05:52a
	No, that's my stunt double, Cliff Booth.	40	70	00:05:52b
	Yeah.	05	71	00:05:55a
	Good to meet you.	17	72	00:05:55b
	We've worked together since the last two seasons of Bounty Law.	63	73	00:05:59a
	Yeah?	05	74	00:05:59b
	My car's in the shop, so he gave me a ride.	43	75	00:06:02a
	That's a big fucking lie.	25	76	00:06:03a
	Rick got his driver's license taken away for too many drunk-driving tickets.	76	77	00:06:07a
	Cliff drives him everywhere now.	32	78	00:06:09a
	Fuck.	05	79	00:06:10a
	Well, sounds like a good friend.	32	80	00:06:11a
	I try.	06	81	00:06:11b
	Mm.	03	82	00:06:13a
	I wanna send you greetings from my wife,	40	83	00:06:18a
	Mary Alice Schwarz.	19	84	00:06:18b
	Well, that's nice.	18	85	00:06:22a
	Thanks a lot.	13	86	00:06:26a
	We had a Rick Dalton double feature in our screening room last night.	69	87	00:06:31a
	Well, that's both flattering and-and embarrassing.	50	88	00:06:36a
	What'd you see?	15	89	00:06:37a
	Thirty-five mm prints of Tanner and	35	90	00:06:40a
	The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.	32	91	00:06:49a
	I hope the, Rick Dalton double feature wasn't too painful for you and the...	76	92	00:06:52a
	And the missus.	15	93	00:06:55a
	No.	03	94	00:06:55b
	Painful.	08	95	00:06:55c
	Stop.	05	96	00:06:55d
	What are you saying?	20	97	00:07:01a
	Mary Alice loves Westerns.	26	98	00:07:03a
	Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns.	41	99	00:07:05a
	Here you go.	12	100	00:07:05b
	Thanks.	07	101	00:07:06a
	And we thoroughly enjoyed Tanner.	33	102	00:07:09a
	That's nice.	12	103	00:07:10a
	It's really good.	17	104	00:07:10b
	And anyway, she goes to bed.	28	105	00:07:12a
	I open up a box of Havanas.	27	106	00:07:16a
	I light up, I pour myself a cognac and I watch...	49	107	00:07:22a
	The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.	32	108	00:07:25a
	What a picture.	15	109	00:07:26a
	Good picture, yeah.	19	110	00:07:28a
	That is so much fun.	20	111	00:07:30a
	All the shooting.	17	112	00:07:35a
	I love that stuff.	18	113	00:07:35b
	You know, the killing.	22	114	00:07:37a
	A lot of killing.	17	115	00:07:37b
	Lot of killing, yeah.	21	116	00:07:39a
	Now, gentlemen,	15	117	00:07:49a
	the plan is, we reverse our forces und drive the Allies back into the sea.	74	118	00:07:49b
	Genius.	07	119	00:07:50a
	Panzer divisions come in,	25	120	00:07:55a
	and we drive them here to the ocean.	36	121	00:07:55b
	They'll be up against the wall.	31	122	00:07:56a
	They will have nowhere to go.	29	123	00:07:56b
	Yes.	04	124	00:07:58a
	This is the spot...	19	125	00:08:01a
	Hermann.	08	126	00:08:05a
	Open the curtains.	18	127	00:08:26a
	Anybody order fried sauerkraut?	31	128	00:08:45a
	Burn, you Nazi bastards.	24	129	00:08:45b
	Ha-ha-ha.	09	130	00:08:49a
	That's you operating the flamethrower, isn't it?	48	131	00:08:53a
	You bet your sweet ass it was.	30	132	00:08:53b
	Yeah.	05	133	00:08:55a
	It was you?	11	134	00:08:55b
	Yeah.	05	135	00:08:55c
	And let me tell you,	20	136	00:09:01a
	that-that's one shit-fuck crazy weapon y-y-you do not wanna be on the wrong side of.	84	137	00:09:01b
	Boy, boy.	09	138	00:09:03a
	You know, I practiced with that dragon,	39	139	00:09:08a
	three hours a day for two weeks.	32	140	00:09:08b
	Not just because I wanted to look good in the picture,	54	141	00:09:11a
	but because I was...	20	142	00:09:11b
	I was shit-scared of the thing, to be honest.	45	143	00:09:14a
	Mike fucking Lewis.	19	144	00:09:16a
	Crisping them Nazis to hell.	28	145	00:09:18a
	Shit, that's...	15	146	00:09:20a
	All right, that's too hot.	26	147	00:09:21a
	Anything we can do about that heat?	35	148	00:09:23a
	Rick, it's a flamethrower.	26	149	00:09:23b
	Yeah.	05	150	00:09:26a
	So I came to the office early today,	36	151	00:09:35a
	and I watched two episodes of Bounty Law on 16 mm.	50	152	00:09:35b
	Jody Janice, wanted for cattle rustling in the state of Wyoming,	64	153	00:09:44a
	$425 dead or alive.	19	154	00:09:44b
	And you brought him here to collect.	36	155	00:09:46a
	I don't even know where here is.	32	156	00:09:49a
	It was just the closest place.	30	157	00:09:51a
	Caught up with him about five miles outside of town.	52	158	00:09:54a
	So, bounty killer,	18	159	00:10:02a
	the name of this town is Janicetown.	36	160	00:10:02b
	And that boy you killed...	26	161	00:10:04a
	was Jody Janice.	16	162	00:10:07a
	He was the baby boy of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.	51	163	00:10:11a
	Hmm.	04	164	00:10:13a
	Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?	34	165	00:10:17a
	Well, I'll be sure and introduce you when he gets here.	55	166	00:10:44a
	Bounty Law.	11	167	00:10:49a
	Starring Rick Dalton.	21	168	00:10:52a
	Then a couple of the jokers over in archival sent over a kinescope of a little treat featuring you.	99	169	00:11:20a
	So, you've been doing guest shots on episodic TV shows the last couple of years?	80	170	00:11:26a
	Yeah.	05	171	00:11:26b
	I'm doing a pilot f-for CBS right now.	38	172	00:11:32a
	It's called...	14	173	00:11:32b
	It's called Lancer.	19	174	00:11:32c
	I play the heavy.	17	175	00:11:35a
	Did a, ahem, Ron Ely Tarzan.	28	176	00:11:38a
	I did a Land of the Giants.	27	177	00:11:38b
	Green Hornet.	13	178	00:11:41a
	I did that show, uh...	22	179	00:11:43a
	Bingo Martin with that kid Scott Brown.	39	180	00:11:43b
	Yeah.	05	181	00:11:46a
	And I got a F.B.I.	18	182	00:11:46b
	that-that airs this Sunday.	27	183	00:11:49a
	You, um...	10	184	00:11:49b
	You always play the bad guy on these shows?	43	185	00:11:53a
	Y-yeah.	07	186	00:11:53b
	Mm-hm.	06	187	00:11:53c
	Yeah.	05	188	00:11:56a
	So, and they have a fight scene at the end of them?	51	189	00:11:59a
	Well, not...	12	190	00:11:59b
	Not Land of the Giants or F.B.I.,	33	191	00:12:03a
	but the rest, yeah.	19	192	00:12:03b
	Yeah.	05	193	00:12:03c
	And you lose in the fight?	26	194	00:12:06a
	Yeah.	05	195	00:12:06b
	Yeah, of course.	16	196	00:12:06c
	I'm the heavy.	14	197	00:12:10a
	That's an old trick pulled by the networks.	43	198	00:12:14a
	Now, you take Bingo Martin, for example.	40	199	00:12:16a
	Mm-hm.	06	200	00:12:16b
	Right?	06	201	00:12:18a
	So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.	38	202	00:12:21a
	You wanna build up his bona fides, right?	41	203	00:12:24a
	So you hire a guy from a canceled show to play the heavy.	57	204	00:12:26a
	Hmm.	04	205	00:12:28a
	Then at the end of the show,	28	206	00:12:33a
	when they fight,	16	207	00:12:33b
	it's hero besting heavy.	24	208	00:12:33c
	But what the audience sees is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.	70	209	00:12:41a
	Uh-huh.	07	210	00:12:41b
	You see?	08	211	00:12:43a
	Then next week, it's Ron Ely.	29	212	00:12:46a
	And next week,	14	213	00:12:52a
	it's Bob Conrad,	16	214	00:12:52b
	wearing his tight pants,	24	215	00:12:52c
	kicking your ass.	17	216	00:12:52d
	Yeah.	05	217	00:12:55a
	Now, in another couple of years,	32	218	00:13:06a
	playing punching bag to every swinging dick new to the network,	63	219	00:13:06b
	that's gonna have a psychological effect on how the audience perceives you.	75	220	00:13:06c
	Right.	06	221	00:13:08a
	So, Rick, who's gonna kick the shit out of you next week?	57	222	00:13:13a
	Mannix?	07	223	00:13:13b
	The Man from U.N.C.I.E.?	24	224	00:13:16a
	The Girl from U.N.C.I.E.?	25	225	00:13:18a
	How about Batman and Robin?	27	226	00:13:20a
	Ping.	05	227	00:13:20b
	Pow.	04	228	00:13:22a
	Choom.	06	229	00:13:22b
	Zoom.	05	230	00:13:26a
	Down goes you.	14	231	00:13:27a
	Down goes your career as a leading man.	39	232	00:13:33a
	Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns and win fucking fights?	65	233	00:13:48a
	Ticket, señor?	14	234	00:13:57a
	All right, what's the matter, partner?	38	235	00:14:02a
	it's official, old buddy.	25	236	00:14:02b
	I'm a has-been.	15	237	00:14:06a
	What are you talking about?	27	238	00:14:06b
	What did that guy tell you?	27	239	00:14:09a
	He told me the goddamn truth, is what he told me.	49	240	00:14:13a
	Whoa.	05	241	00:14:13b
	Shit.	05	242	00:14:15a
	Hey.	04	243	00:14:15b
	I'm sorry about that.	21	244	00:14:17a
	Sorry about that.	17	245	00:14:18a
	Here.	05	246	00:14:18b
	Put these on.	13	247	00:14:20a
	Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.	35	248	00:14:22a
	Son of a bitch.	15	249	00:14:22b
	What's got you so upset, man?	29	250	00:14:24a
	Well, if coming face-to-face with the failure that is your career ain't worth crying about,	91	251	00:14:31a
	then I don't know what the fuck is.	35	252	00:14:31b
	Right.	06	253	00:14:31c
	That guy in there turn you down?	32	254	00:14:33a
	No.	03	255	00:14:33b
	He wants to help me get into Italian movies.	44	256	00:14:36a
	Then what's the problem?	24	257	00:14:38a
	I gotta do Italian goddamn movies.	34	258	00:14:40a
	That's the fucking problem.	27	259	00:14:40b
	Come on.	08	260	00:14:42a
	Fucking bullshit.	17	261	00:14:42b
	It doesn't matter whether I cry in public.	42	262	00:14:45a
	Nobody remembers who the fuck I am anyway, huh?	47	263	00:14:47a
	At the Hall of Justice here.	28	264	00:14:49a
	The defense will try to prove the killing of Kennedy was the product of a sick mind.	84	265	00:14:52a
	Fuck.	05	266	00:14:53a
	Thank you.	10	267	00:14:53b
	Hey, let's go.	14	268	00:14:53c
	Take me home, Cliff.	20	269	00:14:56a
	Come on, take me home.	22	270	00:14:58a
	As early as next Wednesday.	27	271	00:15:00a
	More than 1000 Communists dead are reported in new,	51	272	00:15:06a
	large-scale fighting in South Vietnam.	38	273	00:15:06b
	U.S. losses are said to be...	29	274	00:15:07a
	That's swell, man.	18	275	00:15:10a
	Fucking hippie motherfuckers.	29	276	00:15:12a
	And bases with rockets and mortar fire.	39	277	00:15:15a
	As President Nixon was flying to Europe,	40	278	00:15:45a
	he received details of that fighting by radio.	46	279	00:15:45b
	Hot dog buns.	13	280	00:16:11a
	Five years of ascent.	21	281	00:16:11b
	Pfft.	05	282	00:16:13a
	Ten years of-of-of treading water.	34	283	00:16:16a
	And now a race to the bottom.	29	284	00:16:16b
	Heh.	04	285	00:16:20a
	Look, I never had much of a career to speak of,	47	286	00:16:25a
	so I can't say I really know how you feel.	42	287	00:16:25b
	What are you talking about?	27	288	00:16:25c
	You're my stunt double.	23	289	00:16:28a
	Come on, now.	13	290	00:16:28b
	Shit.	05	291	00:16:29a
	Rick, I'm your driver, man.	27	292	00:16:29b
	I'm-I'm your gofer.	19	293	00:16:33a
	I'm not complaining, man.	25	294	00:16:33b
	I like driving you around.	26	295	00:16:36a
	I like doing shit around the house and house-sitting in the Hollywood Hills when you're gone.	93	296	00:16:42a
	But I haven't been a full-time stuntman for a while now,	56	297	00:16:52a
	and from where I'm standing,	28	298	00:16:52b
	going to Rome to star in movies does not sound like the fate worse than death that you seem to think it is.	107	299	00:16:52c
	Come on, now.	13	300	00:16:52d
	You ever seen an-an Italian Western, huh?	41	301	00:16:57a
	They're awful.	14	302	00:16:57b
	It's a fucking farce.	21	303	00:16:59a
	Yeah, how many you seen?	24	304	00:16:59b
	One?	04	305	00:16:59c
	Two?	04	306	00:17:02a
	I've seen enough, all right?	28	307	00:17:02b
	Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.	32	308	00:18:02a
	Hell, man, stay in I.A.	23	309	00:18:03a
	Give it what fer next pilot season.	35	310	00:18:05a
	I'm too insecure now to score come pilot season.	48	311	00:18:11a
	Screen Gems ain't gonna have nothing good to say about me.	58	312	00:18:14a
	You know that.	14	313	00:18:14b
	Shit.	05	314	00:18:14c
	You made Bounty Law.	20	315	00:18:16a
	Nobody's gonna forgive me for that last season.	47	316	00:18:18a
	No matter what I do...	22	317	00:18:20a
	I'm always gonna be the horse's ass that got Bounty Law canceled because I wanted some fucking rinky-dink movie career.	119	318	00:18:29a
	Tom.	04	319	00:18:29b
	My friend.	10	320	00:18:29c
	I met him?	10	321	00:18:32a
	No, you haven't met him.	24	322	00:18:33a
	You won't meet him because I don't think you'd like him.	56	323	00:18:35a
	Why?	04	324	00:18:40a
	Don't even joke.	16	325	00:18:40b
	A joke?	07	326	00:18:40c
	But they're scared.	19	327	00:18:57a
	Holy shit.	10	328	00:18:57b
	Heh.	04	329	00:18:59a
	That was Polanski.	18	330	00:19:01a
	That was Roman Polanski.	24	331	00:19:03a
	He's lived there for a month now.	33	332	00:19:05a
	First time I seen him.	22	333	00:19:05b
	Ha-ha-ha.	09	334	00:19:08a
	Holy shit.	10	335	00:19:08b
	Goddamn it.	11	336	00:19:13a
	What do I always say?	21	337	00:19:14a
	Most important thing in this town is,	37	338	00:19:18a
	when you're making money,	25	339	00:19:18b
	you buy a house in town.	24	340	00:19:18c
	You don't rent.	15	341	00:19:18d
	Eddie O'Brien taught me that.	29	342	00:19:21a
	Hollywood real estate means you live here.	42	343	00:19:23a
	You're not just visiting,	25	344	00:19:27a
	not just passing through.	25	345	00:19:27b
	You fucking live here.	22	346	00:19:29a
	Here I am flat on my ass,	25	347	00:19:33a
	and who I got living next door to me?	37	348	00:19:33b
	The director of Rosemary's fucking Baby,	40	349	00:19:36a
	Polanski, the hottest director in town right now,	49	350	00:19:40a
	probably the world.	19	351	00:19:40b
	He's my next-door neighbor.	27	352	00:19:42a
	I mean, shit.	13	353	00:19:42b
	I mean, who knows what could happen?	36	354	00:19:45a
	I could...	10	355	00:19:45b
	I could be one pool party away f-from starring in a new Polanski movie.	71	356	00:19:49a
	So you're feeling better now?	29	357	00:19:51a
	Yeah, yeah.	11	358	00:19:51b
	Sorry about all that.	21	359	00:19:53a
	Give me my glasses back.	24	360	00:19:55a
	Come get them, fucker.	22	361	00:19:57a
	All right, all right, Audie Murphy, relax.	42	362	00:19:59a
	There you go.	13	363	00:19:59b
	You need me for anything else?	30	364	00:20:01a
	I got a lot of lines to learn for tomorrow.	43	365	00:20:04a
	Shit.	05	366	00:20:04b
	All right.	10	367	00:20:04c
	I'm gonna get my carcass on home.	33	368	00:20:07a
	All right.	10	369	00:20:07b
	15 a.m. Seven-fifteen.	22	370	00:20:09a
	Out the door.	13	371	00:20:11a
	In the car.	11	372	00:20:13a
	All right, see you then.	24	373	00:23:06a
	Hello, coming in.	17	374	00:23:06b
	Hello.	06	375	00:23:09a

	Hello, sweetheart.	18	380	00:23:17a
	How was your day?	17	381	00:23:17b
	Hmm?	04	382	00:23:21a
	Wait till you see what I got for you.	37	383	00:23:23a
	Wait until you see what I got for you.	38	384	00:23:26a
	Look what I got for you.	24	385	00:23:28a
	Gonna blow your mind, man.	26	386	00:23:34a
	Come here.	10	387	00:23:34b
	Ta, ta, ta.	11	388	00:23:38a
	Oh.	03	389	00:24:41a
	Was that a whine?	17	390	00:24:44a
	What did I tell you about whining?	34	391	00:24:46a
	You whine, you don't eat.	25	392	00:24:47a
	I will throw this shit in the trash.	36	393	00:24:49a
	I don't wanna, but I will.	26	394	00:24:52a
	You understand?	15	395	00:24:53a
	All right.	10	396	00:25:31a
	I waited at the bar till closing time,	38	397	00:25:36a
	but he never came back.	23	398	00:25:36b
	Okay, Peggy, what happened?	27	399	00:25:38a
	I don't know.	13	400	00:25:38b
	Everything was fine.	20	401	00:25:41a
	We had dinner at my house.	26	402	00:25:43a
	And afterwards,	15	403	00:25:46a
	you know, while I was doing the dishes,	39	404	00:25:46b
	He and Tobey played.	20	405	00:25:49a
	And then, at the club, Gabe was doing great.	44	406	00:25:51a
	Then, wham, a sudden change.	28	407	00:25:53a
	You know how musicians are.	27	408	00:25:53b
	They're temperamental cats.	27	409	00:25:57a
	Who knows what got into him?	28	410	00:25:57b
	Yeah.	05	411	00:26:05a
	Rick Dalton rehearsal tape starting in five,	44	412	00:26:12a
	four, three, two, one.	22	413	00:26:12b
	Pepe, get your behind behind that bar.	38	414	00:26:12c
	I got a guest.	14	415	00:26:16a
	Johnny says...	14	416	00:26:18a
	Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.	26	417	00:26:21a
	How's the beans?	16	418	00:26:22a
	I've had worse.	15	419	00:26:25a
	Johnny says...	14	420	00:26:25b
	Spanish.	08	421	00:26:28a
	A toast.	08	422	00:26:30a
	To my wife and all my sweethearts.	34	423	00:26:32a
	May they never meet.	20	424	00:26:35a
	Señor Madrid, care to join me at my table where I entertain my guests?	70	425	00:26:40a
	I would be delighted, Monsieur Dakota.	38	426	00:26:45a
	Take the bottle with you.	25	427	00:26:48a
	And Pepe comes over.	20	428	00:26:50a
	Hey, where's that chili pepper daughter of yours with the fiddle?	65	429	00:26:54a
	She's asleep.	13	430	00:26:56a
	Well, wake her the heck up,	27	431	00:27:01a
	get her down here with her fiddle and her bow,	46	432	00:27:01b
	and entertain my guests.	24	433	00:27:01c
	Sí, señor, but please don't hurt her this time, I beg you.	58	434	00:27:05a
	I ain't gonna hurt her.	23	435	00:27:07a
	Just want her to play the fiddle.	33	436	00:27:09a
	Fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,	57	437	00:27:15a
	she play her little chili pepper heart out.	43	438	00:27:15b
	So, Johnny, what else you heard about me?	41	439	00:27:18a
	I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,	42	440	00:27:23a
	but Lancer has money.	21	441	00:27:23b
	At some point,	14	442	00:27:29a
	he's gonna hire some guns and push back.	40	443	00:27:29b
	Oops, sorry.	12	444	00:27:29c
	It's okay.	10	445	00:27:31a
	I'll open the door for you.	27	446	00:27:33a
	You look good.	14	447	00:27:47a
	I think Steve's gonna be there too.	35	448	00:27:49a
	Yeah.	05	449	00:29:04a
	Look.	05	450	00:29:04b
	They're here.	13	451	00:29:21a
	Welcome to the Playboy Mansion, Mr. Polanski.	45	452	00:29:24a
	Hey, how are you doing, baby?	29	453	00:29:27a
	Hey.	04	454	00:29:27b
	Heh.	04	455	00:29:27c
	How are you?	12	456	00:29:43a
	Cass.	05	457	00:29:57a
	Yeah.	05	458	00:30:04a
	Yeah, baby.	11	459	00:30:08a
	Yeah.	05	460	00:30:08b
	Whoo.	05	461	00:30:08c
	Yeah.	05	462	00:30:54a
	I'm gonna tell you a story.	27	463	00:30:57a
	She was engaged to him.	23	464	00:31:03a
	Then she flew to the UK...	26	465	00:31:09a
	to make a film with him,	24	466	00:31:19a
	and broke off her engagement with him and married him.	54	467	00:31:19b
	Then they moved to Los Angeles,	31	468	00:31:27a
	and the three of them have been inseparable.	44	469	00:31:27b
	Really?	07	470	00:31:31a
	What's up?	10	471	00:31:34a
	Jay loves Sharon, that's what's up.	35	472	00:31:37a
	Mm.	03	473	00:31:37b
	And he knows...	15	474	00:31:41a
	as sure as God made little green apples...	42	475	00:31:45a
	that one of these days,	23	476	00:31:52a
	that Polish prick's gonna fuck things up,	41	477	00:31:52b
	and when he does,	17	478	00:31:52c
	Jay's gonna be there.	21	479	00:31:52d
	Well, one thing's for sure.	27	480	00:31:55a
	Yeah?	05	481	00:31:56a
	What's that?	12	482	00:31:58a
	Sharon absolutely has a type.	29	483	00:32:03a
	Cute, short, talented guys who look like 12-year-old boys.	58	484	00:32:08a
	Yeah.	05	485	00:32:13a
	I never stood a chance.	23	486	00:32:54a
	Argh.	05	487	00:32:54b
	Fuck you, Dr. Sapirstein.	25	488	00:33:40a
	Here we are.	12	489	00:33:45a
	Tell transpo.	13	490	00:33:45b
	Gonna need to move all that out.	32	491	00:33:49a
	Just a sec.	11	492	00:33:49b
	Hold on, guys.	14	493	00:33:52a
	Go ahead.	09	494	00:33:56a
	You can talk to him.	20	495	00:33:56b
	Just talk to him.	17	496	00:33:58a
	Get that set in place.	22	497	00:33:58b
	Hey.	04	498	00:34:00a
	Ahem.	05	499	00:34:00b
	I think the wind blew down my TV antenna last night,	52	500	00:34:08a
	so while I piss-fart around with wardrobe,	42	501	00:34:08b
	you mind going home and fixing it?	34	502	00:34:08c
	I can.	06	503	00:34:08d
	You talk to the stunt gaffer about me today?	44	504	00:34:11a
	That way I'll know if I'm working this week or not.	51	505	00:34:14a
	Yeah.	05	506	00:34:14b
	Ahem.	05	507	00:34:14c
	I've been meaning to tell you.	30	508	00:34:16a
	The guy who gaffs this,	23	509	00:34:20a
	he's best friends with Randy,	29	510	00:34:20b
	the gaffer from	15	511	00:34:20c
	The Green Hornet...	19	512	00:34:22a
	so there ain't no point.	24	513	00:34:25a
	If you don't need me, I'll pick you up at wrap.	47	514	00:34:27a
	I don't need you.	17	515	00:34:27b
	Not today.	10	516	00:34:29a
	Go home, fix my antenna, do whatever.	37	517	00:34:29b
	See you at wrap.	16	518	00:34:36a
	Hey.	04	519	00:34:38a
	You're Rick fucking Dalton.	27	520	00:34:38b
	Don't you forget it.	20	521	00:34:51a
	Hey, hey.	09	522	00:34:53a
	Hey, buddy, I'm Rick Dalton.	28	523	00:34:54a
	You know where I'm supposed to go?	34	524	00:34:56a
	They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer.	46	525	00:34:58a
	Where's the makeup trailer?	27	526	00:35:00a
	Straight back the way you came, hard right.	43	527	00:35:07a
	My God.	07	528	00:35:15a
	Rick Dalton.	12	529	00:35:16a
	Sam Wanamaker.	14	530	00:35:18a
	Hey.	04	531	00:35:19a
	Sorry about the wet hand.	25	532	00:35:21a
	Don't worry.	12	533	00:35:21b
	I'm used to it with Yul.	24	534	00:35:23a
	I want you to know, I'm the one who cast you.	45	535	00:35:25a
	And I couldn't be more delighted you're doing this.	51	536	00:35:28a
	Well, thank you.	16	537	00:35:29a
	I appreciate it.	16	538	00:35:29b
	It's a good part.	17	539	00:35:32a
	Yeah, it is.	12	540	00:35:32b
	Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?	40	541	00:35:35a
	Not yet, no.	12	542	00:35:35b
	No.	03	543	00:35:36a
	Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.	49	544	00:35:39a
	Mm.	03	545	00:35:40a
	Well, it sounds exciting.	25	546	00:35:43a
	Yeah, lightning in a bottle.	28	547	00:35:43b
	Mm.	03	548	00:35:45a
	Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?	36	549	00:35:47a
	Hi.	03	550	00:35:48a
	And this is Rebekka, who does costumes.	39	551	00:35:50a
	Hello.	06	552	00:35:52a
	Hi.	03	553	00:35:52b
	Howdy.	06	554	00:35:53a
	I want a whole new look for Caleb.	34	555	00:35:55a
	I don't want this Western costumed the way they costumed	56	556	00:35:57a
	The Big Valley and Bonanza for the last decade.	47	557	00:36:00a
	I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.	41	558	00:36:05a
	I mean, nothing anachronistic,	30	559	00:36:11a
	but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?	34	560	00:36:11b
	Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.	39	561	00:36:13a
	Mm.	03	562	00:36:15a
	First off, I want to give him a mustache.	41	563	00:36:17a
	A big, droopy, Zapata-like mustache.	36	564	00:36:21a
	Now, about his jacket.	22	565	00:36:24a
	I want to give him a hippie jacket.	35	566	00:36:25a
	Something he could wear into the London Fog tonight and look like the hippest guy in the room.	94	567	00:36:30a
	Far out.	08	568	00:36:30b
	We got a Custer jacket.	23	569	00:36:32a
	Fringes all down the arm.	25	570	00:36:34a
	It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,	38	571	00:36:39a
	he could hit the Strip in it tonight.	37	572	00:36:39b
	That's my girl.	15	573	00:36:39c
	Heh.	04	574	00:36:41a
	Now, Rick, about your hair.	27	575	00:36:41b
	What about my hair?	19	576	00:36:44a
	I want to go with a different hairstyle.	40	577	00:36:46a
	Huh.	04	578	00:36:46b
	What?	05	579	00:36:47a
	Something more hippie-ish.	26	580	00:36:50a
	You want me to look like a hippie?	34	581	00:36:53a
	Well, think less hippie, Hells Angel.	37	582	00:37:00a
	Right.	06	583	00:37:00b
	Get me the...	13	584	00:37:02a
	Sam.	04	585	00:37:02b
	Sam, uh...	10	586	00:37:05a
	if you got me covered up in all this...	39	587	00:37:07a
	this junk, how's the audience gonna know it's me?	49	588	00:37:12a
	I hope they don't.	18	589	00:37:14a
	Mm.	03	590	00:37:15a
	I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.	37	591	00:37:20a
	I want them to see Caleb.	25	592	00:37:22a
	I hired you to be an actor, Rick.	33	593	00:37:25a
	Not a TV cowboy.	16	594	00:37:25b
	You're better than that.	24	595	00:40:40a
	I've been meaning to tell you,	30	596	00:40:46a
	the guy who gaffs this,	23	597	00:40:46b
	he's best friends with Randy,	29	598	00:40:46c
	the gaffer from	15	599	00:40:46d
	The Green Hornet, so there really ain't no point.	49	600	00:41:05a
	Hey, Randy.	11	601	00:41:09a
	Cliff.	06	602	00:41:11a
	So you're still with Rick, huh?	31	603	00:41:13a
	Still here.	11	604	00:41:15a
	He in there?	12	605	00:41:16a
	Yeah.	05	606	00:41:16b
	Just knock.	11	607	00:41:23a
	Look, just put him in the wardrobe, all right?	46	608	00:41:26a
	What's it gonna hurt?	21	609	00:41:27a
	Then if you need him, you got him.	34	610	00:41:29a
	But then I gotta have a conversation with that wardrobe assistant,	66	611	00:41:32a
	and, man, she's a fucking bitch.	32	612	00:41:32b
	I just don't...	15	613	00:41:32c
	Please, I...	12	614	00:41:35a
	Look, Randy, I'm asking you to help me out, man.	48	615	00:41:38a
	If the answer's no,	19	616	00:41:42a
	the answer's no,	16	617	00:41:42b
	not no with excuses.	20	618	00:41:42c
	Hey, man.	09	619	00:41:45a
	This ain't a fucking Andy McLaglen picture, you know?	53	620	00:41:48a
	I can't afford to hire a bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes and sit around talking to each other all day on the chance that I might use them.	140	621	00:41:55a
	I got a four-man team here, Rick.	33	622	00:41:56a
	If I need more than that, I gotta get it approved.	50	623	00:41:59a
	And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.	43	624	00:42:02a
	Hey, and if your dudes were a better match for me,	50	625	00:42:09a
	I'd say, Okay,	14	626	00:42:09b
	you got me, but-but that's not the case,	40	627	00:42:09c
	and you know it.	16	628	00:42:09d
	He's a great match for me.	26	629	00:42:09e
	Yeah, no...	11	630	00:42:11a
	Hey, you could do anything you want to him.	43	631	00:42:13a
	Throw him off a building, right?	32	632	00:42:13b
	Light him on fire.	18	633	00:42:16a
	Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?	38	634	00:42:18a
	Get creative.	13	635	00:42:18b
	Do whatever you want.	21	636	00:42:20a
	He's just happy for the opportunity.	36	637	00:42:22a
	Rick.	05	638	00:42:22b
	Yeah?	05	639	00:42:26a
	I don't dig him.	16	640	00:42:30a
	And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.	44	641	00:42:33a
	What, is there some old beef between the two of you?	52	642	00:42:36a
	Come on, man.	13	643	00:42:36b
	What?	05	644	00:42:36c
	The dude killed his fucking wife.	33	645	00:42:42a
	Come on, man.	13	646	00:42:42b
	You don't believe that old shit, do you?	40	647	00:42:46a
	Yes, Rick, I do.	16	648	00:42:47a
	And I work with my wife, and she believes it.	45	649	00:42:51a
	She doesn't want his creepy ass around.	39	650	00:42:55a
	You know, this is probably the shittiest weather ever.	54	651	00:42:59a
	The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat with the shittiest person.	70	652	00:43:06a
	Natalie, my sister, said, He's a loser.	39	653	00:43:06b
	He's a loser.	13	654	00:43:09a
	They all said it,	17	655	00:43:13a
	He's a fucking loser,	21	656	00:43:13b
	and I didn't believe them.	26	657	00:43:13c
	So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.	33	658	00:43:16a
	And now you're not gonna talk to me?	36	659	00:43:18a
	What, you don't feel like fighting?	35	660	00:43:20a
	Well, I feel like fucking fighting because I've been up here by myself for four hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.	121	661	00:43:28a
	Yeah.	05	662	00:43:31a
	H-he's a goddamn war hero.	26	663	00:43:31b
	Fuck.	05	664	00:43:37a
	Yeah, appreciate it.	20	665	00:43:42a
	Okay, you fucking horse's ass.	30	666	00:43:42b
	Let's get you over to wardrobe.	31	667	00:43:50a
	Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,	30	668	00:43:55a
	but you don't stunt,	20	669	00:43:55b
	I don't pay you.	16	670	00:43:55c
	Appreciate the opportunity, Randy.	34	671	00:43:55d
	I won't let you down.	21	672	00:43:58a
	You know my wife Janet, don't you?	34	673	00:44:01a
	Yeah.	05	674	00:44:02a
	Steer clear of her.	19	675	00:44:05a
	Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.	33	676	00:44:08a
	What I admire is,	17	677	00:44:13a
	in his sport, there's an element of true combat.	48	678	00:44:13b
	When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the ring,	49	679	00:44:18a
	that's not two athletes posturing.	34	680	00:44:18b
	That's combat.	14	681	00:44:20a
	Two men trying to kill each other right now.	44	682	00:44:23a
	If you don't beat him...	24	683	00:44:25a
	he kills you.	13	684	00:44:27a
	That's beyond athletics.	24	685	00:44:29a
	That's beyond Wide World of Sports, you know?	45	686	00:44:33a
	That's two warriors engaged in combat.	38	687	00:44:35a
	That's what I admire.	21	688	00:44:37a
	In martial arts tournaments,	28	689	00:44:41a
	they won't let you fight like that.	35	690	00:44:41b
	It's very frustrating.	22	691	00:44:43a
	You stand in front of a guy,	28	692	00:44:44a
	and you just wanna let him have it.	35	693	00:44:44b
	Ha.	03	694	00:44:47a
	But you can't.	14	695	00:44:49a
	So you gotta do this playacting,	32	696	00:44:53a
	Cassius Clay.	13	697	00:44:53b
	Sonny Liston.	13	698	00:44:53c
	Joe Louis.	10	699	00:44:56a
	The colored boxer,	18	700	00:45:00a
	not that white kickboxing asshole.	34	701	00:45:00b
	They do what they need to do to win.	36	702	00:45:03a
	They unleash as much punishment as they have to to defeat the other guy.	72	703	00:45:09a
	But in martial arts tournaments,	32	704	00:45:13a
	I do to win what they do to win.	32	705	00:45:13b
	I unleash all my power.	23	706	00:45:17a
	I kill people.	14	707	00:45:18a
	If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?	42	708	00:45:21a
	Well, that would never happen.	30	709	00:45:23a
	But if you did, what do you think would happen?	47	710	00:45:27a
	I'd make him a cripple.	23	711	00:45:32a
	Hey, you.	09	712	00:45:32b
	What's your name?	17	713	00:45:35a
	Me?	03	714	00:45:35b
	Yeah, you.	10	715	00:45:38a
	My name's Cliff.	16	716	00:45:40a
	I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.	31	717	00:45:42a
	Stuntman?	09	718	00:45:42b
	Yeah.	05	719	00:45:45a
	You know, you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.	47	720	00:45:48a
	That's what they tell me.	25	721	00:45:50a
	So did I say something funny, stuntman?	39	722	00:45:54a
	Yeah, you kind of did.	22	723	00:45:54b
	What's so funny?	16	724	00:45:57a
	Look, man, I don't want any trouble.	36	725	00:45:59a
	I'm just here to do a job.	26	726	00:46:00a
	But you're laughing at what I'm saying.	39	727	00:46:02a
	But I'm not saying anything funny.	34	728	00:46:04a
	So, what do you think is so funny?	34	729	00:46:08a
	What I think is...	18	730	00:46:12a
	you're a little man with a big mouth and a big chip,	52	731	00:46:22a
	and I think you should be embarrassed to suggest you'd be anything more than a stain on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.	122	732	00:46:22b
	Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.	43	733	00:46:25a
	And I would really enjoy closing it,	36	734	00:46:30a
	especially in front of all my friends.	38	735	00:46:30b
	But my hands are registered as lethal weapons.	46	736	00:46:33a
	That means, we get into a fight,	32	737	00:46:39a
	I accidentally kill you,	24	738	00:46:39b
	Anybody accidentally kills anybody in a fight,	46	739	00:46:43a
	they go to jail.	16	740	00:46:43b
	It's called manslaughter.	25	741	00:46:44a
	And I think all that lethal weapon horseshit is just an excuse so you dancers never have to get in a real fight.	112	742	00:46:51a
	Okay.	05	743	00:46:54a
	How about a friendly contest?	29	744	00:46:57a
	No punching in the face.	24	745	00:46:59a
	Two out of three.	17	746	00:47:00a
	Who puts who on the ground first?	33	747	00:47:02a
	Nobody tries to hurt nobody,	28	748	00:47:11a
	just who ends up on their butt?	31	749	00:47:11b
	That's a great idea, Kato.	26	750	00:47:25a
	You know, Bruce, that guy's kind of famous.	43	751	00:47:27a
	That guy?	09	752	00:47:29a
	For what?	09	753	00:47:30a
	Killed his wife and got away with it.	37	754	00:47:33a
	That guy?	09	755	00:47:34a
	Not bad, Kato.	14	756	00:48:03a
	Try that again.	15	757	00:48:46a
	Whoa.	05	758	00:48:48a
	What the fuck is going on here?	31	759	00:48:50a
	Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.	38	760	00:48:53a
	What the fuck are you thinking?	31	761	00:48:55a
	You're right, Janet.	20	762	00:48:55b
	I'm sorry about that.	21	763	00:48:58a
	Don't fucking Janet me, you prick.	34	764	00:49:00a
	Hey.	04	765	00:49:00b
	What's up, babe?	16	766	00:49:03a
	What's up, Randy,	17	767	00:49:09a
	is that your loser asshole,	27	768	00:49:09b
	wife-killing buddy boy here was beating the shit out of Bruce.	62	769	00:49:09c
	What?	05	770	00:49:11a
	Hey, Randy.	11	771	00:49:11b
	Cliff.	06	772	00:49:13a
	What the fuck, man?	19	773	00:49:15a
	Let me just say,	16	774	00:49:18a
	nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.	34	775	00:49:18b
	It was a friendly contest.	26	776	00:49:18c
	He barely touched me.	21	777	00:49:21a
	I think that dent in the car says something different.	54	778	00:49:25a
	My God.	07	779	00:49:27a
	What the fuck did you do to my car?.	36	780	00:49:30a
	What the fuck did you do to her car?	36	781	00:49:32a
	I threw this little prick into it,	34	782	00:49:36a
	but I did not know it was her car.	34	783	00:49:36b
	Get the wardrobe off,	21	784	00:49:41a
	get your shit,	14	785	00:49:41b
	and get fucked.	15	786	00:49:41c
	Janet.	06	787	00:49:41d
	What?	05	788	00:49:42a
	I will handle this.	19	789	00:49:43a
	Then fucking handle it, Randy.	30	790	00:49:46a
	Cliff...	08	791	00:49:49a
	get the wardrobe off,	21	792	00:49:57a
	get your shit,	14	793	00:49:57b
	and get off the lot.	20	794	00:49:57c
	Fair enough.	12	795	00:50:32a
	What's the matter?	18	796	00:50:35a
	Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you were dancing to Paul Revere and the Raiders?	86	797	00:50:41a
	Are they not cool enough for you?	33	798	00:50:53a
	Who's this shaggy asshole?	26	799	00:50:57a
	Hello?	06	800	00:50:57b
	Can I help you?	15	801	00:50:58a
	Yeah.	05	802	00:50:58b
	Hey, man.	09	803	00:50:58c
	I'm looking for Terry.	22	804	00:51:01a
	I'm a friend of Terry's and Dennis Wilson's.	44	805	00:51:04a
	Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.	46	806	00:51:07a
	This is the Polanski residence now.	35	807	00:51:08a
	Really?	07	808	00:51:08b
	He moved?	09	809	00:51:11a
	Dang.	05	810	00:51:14a
	You know...?	12	811	00:51:14b
	You know where?	15	812	00:51:15a
	I'm not sure, but the owner of the property,	44	813	00:51:18a
	He's in the guest house.	24	814	00:51:21a
	Who is it, Jay?	15	815	00:51:22a
	It's okay, honey.	17	816	00:51:22b
	It's a friend of Terry's.	25	817	00:51:26a
	Yeah, just take the back path.	30	818	00:51:28a
	Thank you kindly.	17	819	00:51:32a
	Ma'am.	06	820	00:51:49a
	All right, that's an hour.	26	821	00:51:49b
	Hey, Rick.	10	822	00:51:51a
	I know they just broke for lunch,	33	823	00:51:56a
	but you need to wait at least an hour before you can eat.	57	824	00:51:56b
	Give that glue a chance to dry.	31	825	00:51:56c
	No worries, honey.	18	826	00:51:59a
	I got my book.	14	827	00:51:59b
	Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?	37	828	00:52:03a
	You just go straight through the Western town,	46	829	00:52:08a
	take a right and a left,	24	830	00:52:08b
	and you see it right there.	27	831	00:52:08c
	Thanks, honey.	14	832	00:52:12a
	Can we move to number two?	26	833	00:52:14a
	How is his bounce?	18	834	00:52:16a
	Can I get a bounce there?	25	835	00:52:17a
	Just grab the crescent wrench, come right back.	47	836	00:52:20a
	Just make it a quick one.	25	837	00:52:22a
	Tim.	04	838	00:52:22b
	Looks great.	12	839	00:52:22c
	Right there.	12	840	00:53:11a
	Hello.	06	841	00:53:14a
	Would...	08	842	00:53:23a
	Would it bother you if I sat next to you and read my book too?	62	843	00:53:29a
	I don't know.	13	844	00:53:31a
	Would you bother me?	20	845	00:53:34a
	I'll try not to.	16	846	00:53:39a
	Sit.	04	847	00:54:25a
	Ah.	03	848	00:54:27a
	Sorry.	06	849	00:54:27b
	Sorry about that.	17	850	00:54:27c
	Ahem.	05	851	00:54:36a
	You don't eat lunch?	20	852	00:54:39a
	I've got a scene after lunch.	29	853	00:54:41a
	Yeah?	05	854	00:54:44a
	Eating lunch before I do a scene makes me sluggish.	51	855	00:54:47a
	I believe it's the job of an actor...	37	856	00:54:49a
	And I say actor,	16	857	00:54:54a
	not actress, because the word actress is nonsensical.	53	858	00:54:54b
	It's the actor's job to avoid impediments to their performance.	63	859	00:54:59a
	It's the actor's job to strive for 100 percent effectiveness.	61	860	00:55:03a
	Naturally, we never succeed,	28	861	00:55:08a
	but it's the pursuit...	23	862	00:55:08b
	that's meaningful.	18	863	00:55:11a
	Who are you?	12	864	00:55:11b
	You can call me Marabella.	26	865	00:55:14a
	Marabella what?	15	866	00:55:17a
	Marabella Lancer.	17	867	00:55:19a
	No, no, come on, come on.	25	868	00:55:19b
	What's your real name?	22	869	00:55:24a
	When we're on set,	18	870	00:55:28a
	I'd prefer to only be referred to by my character's name.	57	871	00:55:28b
	It helps me invest in the reality of the story.	47	872	00:55:31a
	I've tried it both ways,	24	873	00:55:36a
	and I'm always just a tiny bit better when I don't break character.	67	874	00:55:36b
	And if I can be a tiny bit better, I want to be.	48	875	00:55:43a
	You're the bad guy.	19	876	00:55:43b
	Caleb DeCoteau.	15	877	00:55:49a
	I thought it was pronounced Caleb Dakota.	41	878	00:55:53a
	I'm pretty sure it's DeCoteau.	30	879	00:55:58a
	DeCoteau.	09	880	00:55:58b
	Mm.	03	881	00:56:02a
	DeCoteau.	09	882	00:56:02b
	Hmm.	04	883	00:56:22a
	What are you reading?	21	884	00:56:25a
	It's a biography on Walt Disney.	32	885	00:56:28a
	It's fascinating.	17	886	00:56:29a
	He's a genius, you know.	24	887	00:56:31a
	I mean, a once-in-every-50 or-100-years kind of genius.	55	888	00:56:35a
	What are you, 12?	17	889	00:56:38a
	I'm 8.	06	890	00:56:40a
	What are you reading?	21	891	00:56:43a
	Just a Western.	15	892	00:56:44a
	What does that mean?	20	893	00:56:44b
	Is it good?	11	894	00:56:48a
	Pretty good.	12	895	00:56:48b
	What's the story?	17	896	00:56:52a
	I haven't finished it yet.	26	897	00:56:54a
	I didn't ask for the whole story.	33	898	00:56:57a
	What's the idea of the story?	29	899	00:57:00a
	ahem, it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.	48	900	00:57:06a
	It's the story of his life.	27	901	00:57:09a
	Guy's name is Tom Breezy,	25	902	00:57:14a
	but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.	42	903	00:57:14b
	Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s and-and-and young and good-looking,	72	904	00:57:20a
	He could break any horse that you could throw at him.	53	905	00:57:24a
	Back then, he just had a way.	29	906	00:57:27a
	Now he's into his,	18	907	00:57:33a
	late 30s and he takes a bad fall,	33	908	00:57:33b
	and it messes up his hip.	25	909	00:57:33c
	He's not...	11	910	00:57:33d
	He's not crippled or anything like that, but...	47	911	00:57:38a
	But he's got spine problems he never had before,	48	912	00:57:44a
	and he spends, uh...	20	913	00:57:44b
	more of his days in pain than he ever did before.	49	914	00:57:48a
	Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.	39	915	00:57:52a
	Yeah, it's not bad.	19	916	00:57:55a
	Where are you in it?	20	917	00:57:56a
	About midway.	13	918	00:58:00a
	What's happening to Easy Breezy now?	36	919	00:58:03a
	He's, um...	11	920	00:58:07a
	He's not the best anymore.	26	921	00:58:10a
	In fact, far from it.	21	922	00:58:10b
	he's coming to terms with what it's like to be slightly more...	63	923	00:58:30a
	Slightly more useless each day.	31	924	00:58:50a
	I-it's okay, Caleb.	19	925	00:58:52a
	It's okay.	10	926	00:58:53a
	It sounds like a really sad book.	33	927	00:58:56a
	Poor Easy Breezy.	17	928	00:58:58a
	I'm practically crying,	23	929	00:59:03a
	and I haven't even read it.	27	930	00:59:03b
	About 15 years, you'll be living it.	36	931	00:59:05a
	What?	05	932	00:59:09a
	Nothing, pumpkin puss.	22	933	00:59:09b
	I'm just...	11	934	00:59:13a
	I'm just teasing you.	21	935	00:59:16a
	You know something?	19	936	00:59:16b
	You might be right about this book.	35	937	00:59:22a
	I think it hits harder than I gave it credit for.	49	938	00:59:27a
	I don't like names like pumpkin puss,	37	939	01:00:30a
	but since you're upset,	23	940	01:00:30b
	we'll talk about that some other time.	38	941	01:00:30c
	I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.	42	942	01:00:33a
	Hey, beggars can't be choosers.	31	943	01:00:34a
	Come on in.	11	944	01:00:34b
	Thanks.	07	945	01:00:56a
	Thank you so much.	18	946	01:00:56b
	My pleasure.	12	947	01:00:59a
	Good luck on your adventure.	28	948	01:00:59b
	Thank you.	10	949	01:01:01a
	Have a good time in Big Sur.	28	950	01:01:01b
	Thank you so much.	18	951	01:01:03a
	Take care.	10	952	01:01:03b
	You too.	08	953	01:02:11a
	Hey.	04	954	01:02:11b
	Hello.	06	955	01:02:14a
	How can I help you, young lady?	31	956	01:02:16a
	Oh.	03	957	01:02:19a
	I'm here to pick up a first edition of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles I ordered.	90	958	01:02:23a
	It's under Polanski.	20	959	01:02:24a
	Yeah, you're talking books there, kid.	38	960	01:02:26a
	I know.	07	961	01:02:26b
	Isn't it wonderful?	19	962	01:02:28a
	Yeah.	05	963	01:02:28b
	Man.	04	964	01:02:28c
	I just read it.	15	965	01:02:30a
	I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.	40	966	01:02:30b
	Mm.	03	967	01:02:35a
	Rick Dalton?	12	968	01:02:35b
	You bet.	08	969	01:02:38a
	Jim Stacy.	10	970	01:02:38b
	This is my show.	16	971	01:02:38c
	Welcome aboard.	15	972	01:02:40a
	We're real glad to have a pro like you playing the heavy on the pilot.	70	973	01:02:44a
	And I gotta tell you,	21	974	01:02:46a
	I came damn close to being in	29	975	01:02:46b
	The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.	32	976	01:02:49a
	No kidding.	11	977	01:02:49b
	Yeah.	05	978	01:02:50a
	Let me tell you, I...	21	979	01:02:52a
	I just got my part-part by sheer luck.	38	980	01:02:54a
	Up until two weeks before shooting,	35	981	01:02:58a
	Fabian was in the part.	23	982	01:02:58b
	Then-then he breaks his shoulder doing a Virginian.	51	983	01:03:01a
	That's how I got it, so...	26	984	01:03:02a
	Ah.	03	985	01:03:05a
	Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you something I heard about.	51	986	01:03:08a
	Was it true you almost got the McQueen part in	46	987	01:03:10a
	The Great Escape?	17	988	01:03:13a
	Hilts, isn't it?	16	989	01:03:13b
	Captain Hilts, actually.	24	990	01:03:16a
	Seventeen escape attempts.	26	991	01:03:16b
	Eighteen.	09	992	01:03:18a
	Never had an audition.	22	993	01:03:18b
	Never had a meeting.	20	994	01:03:21a
	Never met John Sturges.	23	995	01:03:22a
	So, no, I don't think you could say I...	40	996	01:03:25a
	I almost got the part, but...	29	997	01:03:27a
	Tunnel man, engineer.	21	998	01:03:27b
	Flier.	06	999	01:03:30a
	I suppose what's called in the American Army,	45	1000	01:03:34a
	a hotshot pilot.	16	1001	01:03:34b
	But the story goes,	19	1002	01:03:45a
	for a brief moment,	19	1003	01:03:45b
	McQueen almost passed on the movie,	35	1004	01:03:45c
	and during that brief moment,	29	1005	01:03:45d
	I, apparently,	14	1006	01:03:45e
	was on a list of four.	22	1007	01:03:45f
	You have other plans?	21	1008	01:03:46a
	I haven't seen Berlin yet from the ground or from the air,	58	1009	01:03:52a
	and I plan on doing both before the war's over.	47	1010	01:03:52b
	You and who?	12	1011	01:03:53a
	Me and...	09	1012	01:03:53b
	Me and three Georges.	21	1013	01:03:53c
	Which three Georges?	20	1014	01:03:56a
	Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.	30	1015	01:03:58a
	Man.	04	1016	01:03:58b
	Yeah.	05	1017	01:04:00a
	That's gotta hurt.	18	1018	01:04:01a
	Yeah, I didn't get it,	22	1019	01:04:09a
	McQueen did it,	15	1020	01:04:09b
	and, frankly, I never had a chance.	35	1021	01:04:09c
	Ten days isolation, Hilts.	26	1022	01:04:11a
	Captain Hilts.	14	1023	01:04:13a
	Twenty days.	12	1024	01:04:14a
	Right.	06	1025	01:04:17a
	You'll still be here when I get out?	36	1026	01:04:21a
	Cooler.	07	1027	01:05:18a
	One, please.	12	1028	01:05:18b
	Seventy-five cents.	19	1029	01:05:23a
	What if I'm in the movie?	25	1030	01:05:26a
	What do you mean?	17	1031	01:05:28a
	I mean, I'm in the movie.	25	1032	01:05:30a
	I'm Sharon Tate.	16	1033	01:05:32a
	You're in this?	15	1034	01:05:32b
	Mm-hm.	06	1035	01:05:35a
	I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.	31	1036	01:05:38a
	That's me.	10	1037	01:05:41a
	But that's the girl from Valley of the Dolls.	45	1038	01:05:45a
	Well, that's me,	16	1039	01:05:49a
	the girl from Valley of the Dolls.	34	1040	01:05:49b
	Really?	07	1041	01:05:51a
	Hey, Rubin.	11	1042	01:05:55a
	Come out here.	14	1043	01:06:00a
	This is the girl from Valley of the Dolls.	42	1044	01:06:03a
	Patty Duke?	11	1045	01:06:03b
	No, the other one.	18	1046	01:06:06a
	The girl from Peyton Place?	27	1047	01:06:06b
	No, the other one.	18	1048	01:06:08a
	The one who ends up doing dirty movies.	39	1049	01:06:10a
	Oh.	03	1050	01:06:10b
	She's in this movie.	20	1051	01:06:13a
	Oh.	03	1052	01:06:13b
	Sharon Tate.	12	1053	01:06:15a
	Well, welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.	38	1054	01:06:19a
	Thank you for coming to our theater.	36	1055	01:06:20a
	Would you like to come in and see the show?	43	1056	01:06:22a
	Could I?	08	1057	01:06:23a
	By all means.	13	1058	01:06:26a
	Thank you.	10	1059	01:06:29a
	Hey, can I get a picture?	25	1060	01:06:31a
	Sure.	05	1061	01:06:32a
	Okay.	05	1062	01:06:37a
	You know, why don't you stand over by the poster so people will know who you are.	81	1063	01:06:41a
	Okay.	05	1064	01:06:41b
	Could you?	10	1065	01:06:56a
	Would you like some refreshments?	33	1066	01:06:58a
	I'm fine.	09	1067	01:06:58b
	Thank you.	10	1068	01:06:58c
	Enjoy the show.	15	1069	01:07:37a
	Can I ask you a personal question?	34	1070	01:07:39a
	I wish you would.	17	1071	01:07:39b
	How did a nice boy like you get involved with a group like the Heads?	69	1072	01:07:44a
	I turned to them after I was rejected by the Daughters of the American Revolution.	82	1073	01:08:11a
	Very pleasant hotel here.	25	1074	01:08:14a
	Mr. Helm?	09	1075	01:08:14b
	Yes?	04	1076	01:08:16a
	Oh.	03	1077	01:08:21a
	I'm Freya.	10	1078	01:08:22a
	Welcome to Denmark, Mr. Helm.	29	1079	01:08:25a
	These are for you.	18	1080	01:08:25b
	Street maps, places of interest.	32	1081	01:08:29a
	This is for you too.	20	1082	01:08:32a
	What year was that?	19	1083	01:08:32b
	1949.	05	1084	01:08:34a
	That's a very good year.	24	1085	01:08:35a
	I'm here to help any way I can.	31	1086	01:08:37a
	Very nice of you.	17	1087	01:08:38a
	Is there anything you'd like me to do?	38	1088	01:08:41a
	Yes, a couple things.	21	1089	01:08:41b
	Yes, sir.	09	1090	01:08:43a
	Would you mind getting off my camera case, please?	50	1091	01:08:46a
	I'm sorry.	10	1092	01:08:46b
	That's all right.	17	1093	01:08:48a
	I'm so sorry.	13	1094	01:08:48b
	That's okay.	12	1095	01:08:50a
	I'm sorry about...	18	1096	01:08:52a
	Welcome to Denmark.	19	1097	01:09:03a
	This is some kind of hotel you've got here.	43	1098	01:09:08a
	Half a bottle is better than none.	34	1099	01:09:20a
	Morning, partner.	17	1100	01:09:22a
	Probably come by to see you later.	34	1101	01:09:58a
	That's far enough, jughead.	27	1102	01:10:01a
	Name's not jughead.	19	1103	01:10:04a
	What you doing around here, boy?	32	1104	01:10:06a
	I'm thirsty.	12	1105	01:10:06b
	That's a saloon, ain't it?	26	1106	01:10:09a
	Yeah, that's a saloon.	22	1107	01:10:12a
	Only you can't come in.	23	1108	01:10:12b
	Mr. Gilbert.	12	1109	01:10:17a
	Don't let me stop you from earning your money.	46	1110	01:10:22a
	I know how bored and restless you get when you run out of tamales.	66	1111	01:10:28a
	But, Mr. Gilbert,	17	1112	01:10:36a
	if I was you, I'd find out that jughead's name.	47	1113	01:10:36b
	Allow me to introduce the two of you.	37	1114	01:10:40a
	This here is Bob Gilbert.	25	1115	01:10:43a
	The Businessman?	16	1116	01:10:45a
	That's right.	13	1117	01:10:47a
	Business Bob Gilbert.	21	1118	01:10:47b
	And who might he be, Caleb?	27	1119	01:10:51a
	Well, that's a fella by the name of Madrid.	43	1120	01:10:55a
	Johnny Madrid.	14	1121	01:10:58a
	Who's Johnny Madrid?	20	1122	01:11:06a
	He ain't from round here.	25	1123	01:11:08a
	No, really.	11	1124	01:11:10a
	Who is he, Caleb?	17	1125	01:11:16a
	You're about to find out...	27	1126	01:11:19a
	Businessman.	12	1127	01:11:38a
	Ready when you are, Gilbert.	28	1128	01:12:23a
	Johnny Madrid.	14	1129	01:12:30a
	How long has it been?	21	1130	01:12:32a
	Since that time in Juárez, about three years ago.	49	1131	01:12:36a
	Well, come on in and have a drink.	34	1132	01:12:39a
	Hell, in that case...	21	1133	01:12:44a
	buy you a drink, Caleb?	23	1134	01:12:46a
	Sure, Johnny.	13	1135	01:12:49a
	How about some mezcal?	22	1136	01:12:51a
	Like that time in Juárez.	25	1137	01:12:55a
	A lot of people died that day.	30	1138	01:12:57a
	Yes, they did.	14	1139	01:13:00a
	But we had a good time.	23	1140	01:13:03a
	Didn't we?	10	1141	01:13:04a
	Yeah, we did.	13	1142	01:13:07a
	After you, DeCoteau.	20	1143	01:13:10a
	Pepe.	05	1144	01:13:10b
	Get your behind behind that bar.	32	1145	01:13:13a
	I have a guest.	15	1146	01:13:31a
	How's the beans?	16	1147	01:13:34a
	I've had worse.	15	1148	01:13:38a
	One dollar.	11	1149	01:13:43a
	To my wife and all my sweethearts.	34	1150	01:13:47a
	May they never meet.	20	1151	01:13:56a
	Señor Madrid, you care to join me at my table where I entertain my guests?	74	1152	01:14:01a
	I'd be delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.	36	1153	01:14:05a
	Take the bottle with you.	25	1154	01:14:09a
	So, Johnny, ahem...	19	1155	01:14:13a
	what brings you to Arroyo del Oro?	34	1156	01:14:14a
	You know me, Caleb.	19	1157	01:14:17a
	Money.	06	1158	01:14:20a
	And who's paying around here?	29	1159	01:14:22a
	I hope you.	11	1160	01:14:24a
	Huh.	04	1161	01:14:26a
	And what have you heard about me?	33	1162	01:14:28a
	I heard about the Lancer Ranch.	31	1163	01:14:30a
	All the cattle you've appropriated.	35	1164	01:14:33a
	A lot of land,	14	1165	01:14:43a
	a lot of cows,	14	1166	01:14:43b
	a lot of money,	15	1167	01:14:43c
	no law to speak of,	19	1168	01:14:43d
	and nothing but an old man and some Mexican ranch hands to shoo you off.	72	1169	01:14:43e
	Say, where's that chili pepper daughter of yours with the fiddle?	65	1170	01:14:48a
	She's asleep.	13	1171	01:14:50a
	Wake her the heck up,	21	1172	01:14:58a
	get her down here with her fiddle and her bow,	46	1173	01:14:58b
	and entertain my guest.	23	1174	01:14:58c
	But, please, don't hurt her this time.	38	1175	01:15:02a
	I ain't gonna hurt her.	23	1176	01:15:03a
	I just want her to play the fiddle.	35	1177	01:15:11a
	Line?	05	1178	01:15:11b
	Go fetch her and tell her what?	31	1179	01:15:14a
	Go fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece...	62	1180	01:15:17a
	Right.	06	1181	01:15:17b
	Go fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat-fat $5 gold piece,	64	1182	01:15:23a
	she play her little chili pepper heart out, right?	50	1183	01:15:23b
	Right.	06	1184	01:15:23c
	Got it.	07	1185	01:15:31a
	I ain't gonna hurt her.	23	1186	01:15:33a
	I just want her to play the fiddle.	35	1187	01:15:35a
	Now, go fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,	65	1188	01:15:41a
	she play her little chili pepper heart out.	43	1189	01:15:41b
	Go on.	06	1190	01:15:48a
	So, Johnny, what else you heard?	32	1191	01:15:52a
	Hmm.	04	1192	01:15:54a
	I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,	42	1193	01:16:00a
	but Lancer's got money.	23	1194	01:16:00b
	At some point,	14	1195	01:16:14a
	he's gonna hire some guns and push back.	40	1196	01:16:14b
	Line.	05	1197	01:16:14c
	Line, line, line.	17	1198	01:16:14d
	Maybe he already has.	21	1199	01:16:20a
	Maybe...	08	1200	01:16:20b
	Goddamn it.	11	1201	01:16:21a
	I fucked this whole thing up.	29	1202	01:16:23a
	Keep going.	11	1203	01:16:24a
	I fucked this up.	17	1204	01:16:24b
	Fight through it.	17	1205	01:16:26a
	Can we just go back?	20	1206	01:16:26b
	Please, can we just cut?	24	1207	01:16:28a
	Just say the fucking line.	26	1208	01:16:30a
	No, really, Sam, please.	24	1209	01:16:31a
	Maybe he already has.	21	1210	01:16:31b
	All right.	10	1211	01:16:33a
	Maybe he already has.	21	1212	01:16:33b
	All right, goddamn it.	22	1213	01:16:35a
	All right, all right.	21	1214	01:16:36a
	Woo.	04	1215	01:16:38a
	You're a goddamn outlaw, Rick.	30	1216	01:16:38b
	Come on, now.	13	1217	01:16:40a
	Woo.	04	1218	01:16:42a
	I got it.	09	1219	01:16:42b
	Go back a bit, would you?	25	1220	01:16:46a
	No, he's right.	15	1221	01:16:46b
	Back to one.	12	1222	01:16:49a
	Okay, now, use all that, baby.	30	1223	01:16:49b
	I'm gonna use it.	17	1224	01:16:51a
	Put it all inside.	18	1225	01:16:54a
	I'm gonna use it.	17	1226	01:16:59a
	action.	07	1227	01:17:03a
	I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,	42	1228	01:17:09a
	but Lancer's got money.	23	1229	01:17:09b
	At some point,	14	1230	01:17:19a
	he's gonna hire some guns and push back.	40	1231	01:17:19b
	Maybe he already has.	21	1232	01:17:22a
	Maybe.	06	1233	01:17:27a
	Maybe I don't like Lancer.	26	1234	01:17:30a
	Maybe I don't like his boots.	29	1235	01:17:33a
	Maybe I don't like the way he uses those boots to step on people.	65	1236	01:17:42a
	What the fuck was that?.	24	1237	01:17:44a
	Jesus Christ.	13	1238	01:17:46a
	Fuck.	05	1239	01:17:48a
	Piece of shit.	14	1240	01:17:50a
	Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.	38	1241	01:17:52a
	Forgot your fucking lines,	26	1242	01:17:57a
	embarrassed yourself like that in front of all those goddamn people.	68	1243	01:17:57b
	You were drinking all night,	28	1244	01:18:03a
	fucking drinking again,	23	1245	01:18:03b
	eight goddamn fucking whiskey sours.	36	1246	01:18:03c
	Fucking bullshit.	17	1247	01:18:08a
	You're a fucking miserable drunk.	33	1248	01:18:10a
	Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.	43	1249	01:18:13a
	I practiced them,	17	1250	01:18:17a
	and now I don't look like I goddamn practiced them.	51	1251	01:18:17b
	You're sitting there like a fucking baboon.	43	1252	01:18:21a
	Fuck.	05	1253	01:18:21b
	Eight fucking whiskey sours.	28	1254	01:18:23a
	I couldn't stop at fucking three or four.	41	1255	01:18:23b
	I have eight.	13	1256	01:18:26a
	Why?.	05	1257	01:18:26b
	You're a fucking alcoholic.	27	1258	01:18:28a
	You fucking drink too much, huh?	32	1259	01:18:29a
	Every fucking night.	20	1260	01:18:29b
	That's it, that's fucking it.	29	1261	01:18:34a
	That's fucking it.	18	1262	01:18:35a
	You stop drinking right now, all right?	39	1263	01:18:37a
	Make a promise to yourself.	27	1264	01:18:39a
	You're gonna stop fucking drinking.	35	1265	01:18:41a
	Fuck it.	08	1266	01:18:46a
	Damn it.	08	1267	01:18:48a
	You show that little fucking girl.	34	1268	01:18:50a
	You're gonna show that goddamn Jim Stacy.	41	1269	01:18:52a
	You're gonna show them on that goddamn fucking set who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?	90	1270	01:18:56a
	Let me tell you something.	26	1271	01:18:58a
	You don't get these lines right,	32	1272	01:19:04a
	I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out tonight.	47	1273	01:19:04b
	All right?	10	1274	01:19:04c
	Your brains are gonna be splattered all over your goddamn pool.	63	1275	01:19:09a
	I mean it, motherfucker.	24	1276	01:19:11a
	Get your shit together.	23	1277	01:20:18a
	Better?	07	1278	01:20:18b
	Okay.	05	1279	01:20:18c
	It's great.	11	1280	01:21:46a
	Hey.	04	1281	01:21:48a
	Hi.	03	1282	01:21:53a
	Huh.	04	1283	01:21:54a
	Woo.	04	1284	01:21:56a
	Shit.	05	1285	01:22:04a
	Fuck you, you fucking pig.	26	1286	01:22:07a
	No.	03	1287	01:22:24a
	Hello, hot stuff.	17	1288	01:22:25a
	Looks like third time's the charm.	34	1289	01:22:28a
	How were those pickles?	23	1290	01:22:33a
	Real good.	10	1291	01:22:35a
	They were the fancy kind.	25	1292	01:22:36a
	Mmm.	04	1293	01:22:36b
	Give me a lift?	15	1294	01:22:41a
	Where are you going?	20	1295	01:22:43a
	I'm going to Chatsworth.	24	1296	01:22:46a
	Chatsworth?	11	1297	01:22:48a
	You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?	98	1298	01:22:53a
	Tourists love to drive me.	26	1299	01:22:55a
	I'm their favorite part of their I.A.	37	1300	01:22:55b
	vacation.	09	1301	01:22:57a
	They'll be telling stories about the Hollywood hippie girl that they gave a ride to the movie ranch for the rest of their lives.	128	1302	01:23:05a
	Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?	24	1303	01:23:08a
	Yeah.	05	1304	01:23:08b
	That's where you're going?	26	1305	01:23:09a
	Spahn Movie Ranch?	18	1306	01:23:10a
	Uh-huh.	07	1307	01:23:11a
	Why you going there?	20	1308	01:23:13a
	I live there.	13	1309	01:23:15a
	Alone?	06	1310	01:23:15b
	No.	03	1311	01:23:18a
	Me and my friends.	18	1312	01:23:20a
	So you and a bunch of friends like you all live at Spahn Movie Ranch?	69	1313	01:23:26a
	Yeah.	05	1314	01:23:29a
	Well, hop in.	13	1315	01:23:29b
	I'll take you there.	20	1316	01:23:32a
	Great.	06	1317	01:23:43a
	Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.	46	1318	01:23:45a
	I know where it is.	19	1319	01:23:48a
	Are you some old cowboy guy that used to make movies there?	59	1320	01:23:52a
	Whoa.	05	1321	01:23:53a
	What?	05	1322	01:23:55a
	I'm just surprised how accurate that description of me really is.	65	1323	01:23:58a
	Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.	61	1324	01:24:02a
	So you used to make Westerns at the ranch back in the old-timey days?	69	1325	01:24:10a
	Well, if by the old-timey days,	31	1326	01:24:16a
	you mean television eight years ago, yeah.	42	1327	01:24:16b
	Are you an actor?	17	1328	01:24:17a
	No, I'm a stuntman.	19	1329	01:24:20a
	You're a stuntman.	18	1330	01:24:23a
	That's way better.	18	1331	01:24:25a
	Why is that way better?	23	1332	01:24:28a
	Actors are phony.	17	1333	01:24:28b
	Oh.	03	1334	01:24:30a
	They just say lines that other people write and pretend to murder people on their stupid TV shows.	98	1335	01:24:36a
	Meanwhile, real people are being murdered every day in Vietnam.	63	1336	01:25:02a
	Want me to suck your cock while driving?	40	1337	01:25:13a
	How old are you?	16	1338	01:25:15a
	What?	05	1339	01:25:16a
	How old are you?	16	1340	01:25:20a
	Man.	04	1341	01:25:23a
	That's the first time anybody asked that in a long time.	56	1342	01:25:26a
	What's the answer?	18	1343	01:25:30a
	Okay.	05	1344	01:25:30b
	We gonna play kiddie games?	27	1345	01:25:35a
	Eighteen.	09	1346	01:25:35b
	Feel better?	12	1347	01:25:37a
	You got some ID,	16	1348	01:25:42a
	you know, like a driver's license or something?	47	1349	01:25:42b
	Are you joking?	15	1350	01:25:42c
	No, I'm not.	12	1351	01:25:44a
	I need to see something official that verifies that you're 18,	62	1352	01:25:54a
	which you don't have because you're not.	40	1353	01:25:54b
	Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.	37	1354	01:25:57a
	That's you.	11	1355	01:25:58a
	Yeah.	05	1356	01:26:04a
	Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.	41	1357	01:26:08a
	But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.	42	1358	01:26:11a
	What I'm too old to do is go to jail for poontang.	50	1359	01:26:17a
	Prison's been trying to get me all my life.	43	1360	01:26:19a
	It ain't got me yet.	20	1361	01:26:19b
	The day it does, it won't be because of you.	44	1362	01:26:24a
	No offense.	11	1363	01:26:28a
	You all right?	14	1364	01:26:30a
	She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?	35	1365	01:26:32a
	I'm fine, Scott.	16	1366	01:26:34a
	They haven't hurt you?	22	1367	01:26:36a
	Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.	27	1368	01:26:39a
	I'll be right out.	18	1369	01:26:42a
	The war.	08	1370	01:26:44a
	I rode with the British cavalry in Indi...	42	1371	01:27:39a
	Stand by, guys.	15	1372	01:27:39b
	We're going in five.	20	1373	01:27:57a
	Lancer's boys are here.	23	1374	01:28:00a
	The old man here?	17	1375	01:28:02a
	Nada.	05	1376	01:28:03a
	But the son is.	15	1377	01:28:07a
	Heh, heh.	09	1378	01:28:09a
	The one from Boston.	20	1379	01:28:12a
	I don't know.	13	1380	01:28:14a
	You from Boston?	16	1381	01:28:15a
	Yes.	04	1382	01:28:16a
	It's the Boston one.	20	1383	01:28:20a
	Keep the others outside.	24	1384	01:28:23a
	Let the brother come in.	24	1385	01:28:26a
	You heard him, Boston.	22	1386	01:28:36a
	Come on in, Boston.	19	1387	01:28:40a
	See, honey?	11	1388	01:28:41a
	I told you they'd come to parlay.	33	1389	01:28:45a
	You all right, honey?	21	1390	01:28:46a
	She's just fine.	16	1391	01:28:49a
	Ain't you, shorty?	18	1392	01:28:52a
	I'm fine, Scott.	16	1393	01:28:54a
	They haven't hurt you?	22	1394	01:28:56a
	Not yet, I ain't.	17	1395	01:28:58a
	But that can all change...	26	1396	01:29:01a
	like that.	10	1397	01:29:08a
	where'd you get that limp?	26	1398	01:29:11a
	From the war.	13	1399	01:29:11b
	Mm.	03	1400	01:29:13a
	Which side?	11	1401	01:29:15a
	I rode with the British cavalry in India.	41	1402	01:29:19a
	Mm.	03	1403	01:29:20a
	What'd they call that outfit?	29	1404	01:29:23a
	Bengal Lancers.	15	1405	01:29:28a
	Now, now, now, that is funny.	29	1406	01:29:30a
	That is funny.	14	1407	01:29:30b
	That's not so funny.	20	1408	01:29:33a
	Don't you get it?	17	1409	01:29:34a
	Bengal Lancer?	14	1410	01:29:36a
	Hm?	03	1411	01:29:38a
	Yeah.	05	1412	01:29:39a
	I get it now.	13	1413	01:29:41a
	That is kind of funny.	22	1414	01:29:41b
	It is.	06	1415	01:29:44a
	You do know kidnapping is a hanging offense.	44	1416	01:29:48a
	So is blowing the heads off little girls.	41	1417	01:29:52a
	But they can only hang me once, right?	38	1418	01:29:58a
	you come down here for a...	27	1419	01:30:00a
	For a Boston social?	20	1420	01:30:03a
	Or we gonna talk price?	23	1421	01:30:03b
	How much?	09	1422	01:30:05a
	I'd say $50, 000 would buy me a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.	68	1423	01:30:13a
	That's a lot of money.	22	1424	01:30:15a
	Well, she's a lot of little girl.	33	1425	01:30:17a
	Or don't you agree?	19	1426	01:30:19a
	I agree.	08	1427	01:30:22a
	So, what's next?	16	1428	01:30:24a
	Well, I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch to fill you in on all the details,	83	1429	01:30:31a
	the one detail I'm gonna fill you in on right now is this.	58	1430	01:30:36a
	I don't want no beaner bronco buster handing me that $50, 000.	62	1431	01:30:41a
	I want the old man himself.	27	1432	01:30:44a
	Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...	40	1433	01:30:50a
	or I heave this little pitcher down a well.	43	1434	01:30:53a
	You got that, Boston?	21	1435	01:30:56a
	Huh?	04	1436	01:30:57a
	Yeah.	05	1437	01:30:59a
	All right, messenger boy.	25	1438	01:31:03a
	Deliver my message.	19	1439	01:31:11a
	Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.	26	1440	01:31:15a
	Settle into it.	15	1441	01:31:17a
	Enjoy it.	09	1442	01:31:19a
	And cut.	08	1443	01:31:22a
	Boy.	04	1444	01:31:24a
	I didn't hurt you there,	24	1445	01:31:25a
	Marabella, with that throw, did I?	34	1446	01:31:25b
	No, no, no.	11	1447	01:31:25c
	I'm good.	09	1448	01:31:28a
	I got pads on.	14	1449	01:31:30a
	And I throw myself on the floor just for fun,	45	1450	01:31:35a
	even when I'm not getting paid.	31	1451	01:31:35b
	The gate's clean.	17	1452	01:31:36a
	Rick, Rick, Rick.	17	1453	01:31:39a
	Put her there.	14	1454	01:31:40a
	That was it.	12	1455	01:31:40b
	Really?	07	1456	01:31:42a
	That was absolutely fantastic.	30	1457	01:31:43a
	Thank you.	10	1458	01:31:43b
	I loved it.	11	1459	01:31:45a
	Your idea about throwing the little girl on the ground just worked like a charm.	80	1460	01:31:49a
	I figured you said Shakespeare, so...	37	1461	01:31:49b
	Yeah.	05	1462	01:31:51a
	That's right.	13	1463	01:31:51b
	That was...	11	1464	01:31:52a
	That's what I mean by scare me.	31	1465	01:31:54a
	Yeah.	05	1466	01:31:54b
	Evil Hamlet scares people.	26	1467	01:31:57a
	All right.	10	1468	01:31:57b
	And by the way...	17	1469	01:31:59a
	Beaner bronco buster?	21	1470	01:31:59b
	Yeah.	05	1471	01:32:01a
	Where the hell did that come from?	34	1472	01:32:03a
	I don't know.	13	1473	01:32:03b
	Improv.	07	1474	01:32:03c
	That was wonderful.	19	1475	01:32:05a
	It was just...	14	1476	01:32:05b
	That was a triple alliterative improv.	38	1477	01:32:09a
	You don't hear those too often.	31	1478	01:32:10a
	Okay?	05	1479	01:32:10b
	We're good.	11	1480	01:32:10c
	All right.	10	1481	01:32:10d
	We don't...?	12	1482	01:32:12a
	Don't need to go again?	23	1483	01:32:12b
	We're done.	11	1484	01:32:14a
	That was fantastic.	19	1485	01:32:14b
	All right.	10	1486	01:32:16a
	Okay, moving on.	16	1487	01:32:16b
	We're in the bordello.	22	1488	01:32:18a
	Next setup.	11	1489	01:32:23a
	That was the best acting I've ever seen in my whole life.	57	1490	01:32:28a
	Thank you.	10	1491	01:32:29a
	Heh.	04	1492	01:32:47a
	Rick fucking Dalton.	20	1493	01:33:02a
	That's a car.	13	1494	01:33:05a
	That's a strange car.	21	1495	01:33:07a
	Snake, go see who's outside.	28	1496	01:33:22a
	So who is it?	13	1497	01:33:24a
	I ain't for sure yet.	21	1498	01:33:26a
	It's a bitchen yellow Coupe de Ville.	37	1499	01:33:28a
	Keep an eye on him.	19	1500	01:34:19a
	Come on.	08	1501	01:34:37a
	Where the hell is everybody?	28	1502	01:34:48a
	Hey, where's Gypsy?	19	1503	01:34:50a
	She's down by the chop shop.	28	1504	01:34:58a
	Hey.	04	1505	01:34:58b
	Hello.	06	1506	01:35:01a
	Gypsy.	06	1507	01:35:01b
	I want you to come meet my new friend.	38	1508	01:35:04a
	Some old-looking dude in a Hawaiian shirt who just gave Pussycat a ride home.	77	1509	01:35:08a
	He just gave her a lift?	24	1510	01:35:10a
	Nope.	05	1511	01:35:10b
	She's bringing him down the ranch to meet everybody.	52	1512	01:35:14a
	Stay by the door.	17	1513	01:35:14b
	Tell me if he starts coming this way.	37	1514	01:35:19a
	Welcome to our community.	25	1515	01:35:19b
	Thanks for having me.	21	1516	01:35:21a
	Thank you for giving our precious Pussy a ride home.	52	1517	01:35:24a
	Think nothing of it.	20	1518	01:35:25a
	We love Pussy.	14	1519	01:35:27a
	Yes, we do.	11	1520	01:35:28a
	Hey, where is everybody?	24	1521	01:35:28b
	Where's the children?	21	1522	01:35:30a
	Everybody left for Santa Barbara.	33	1523	01:35:33a
	Really?	07	1524	01:35:35a
	Charlie's gone?	15	1525	01:35:35b
	Everybody left?	15	1526	01:35:37a
	Well, not everybody everybody,	30	1527	01:35:43a
	but mostly everybody.	21	1528	01:35:43b
	Drag.	05	1529	01:35:45a
	I really wanted Cliff to meet Charlie.	38	1530	01:35:48a
	I think Charlie's really gonna dig you.	39	1531	01:35:50a
	Angel, hold up.	15	1532	01:35:50b
	Well, maybe next time.	22	1533	01:35:53a
	Yeah, you got to come back.	27	1534	01:35:55a
	Yeah?	05	1535	01:35:55b
	Yeah, sure.	11	1536	01:35:59a
	So how's it all comparing to your glory days?	45	1537	01:36:02a
	Well, things have changed.	26	1538	01:36:07a
	Not a bad mount, Connie.	24	1539	01:36:09a
	I used to ride horses every day back in Tennessee.	50	1540	01:36:12a
	Is that right?	14	1541	01:36:12b
	Every day?	10	1542	01:36:14a
	Well, every week.	17	1543	01:36:16a
	All right.	10	1544	01:36:18a
	Ain't she just darling?	23	1545	01:36:23a
	So, my name is Lulu.	20	1546	01:36:26a
	This is Tex.	12	1547	01:36:28a
	We're gonna be leading you on a great trail ride through the beautiful Santa Susana canyons.	92	1548	01:36:33a
	Now, Curt, I hear you're already an experienced rider.	54	1549	01:36:36a
	Yes.	04	1550	01:36:36b
	Yeah, so are you, Connie?	25	1551	01:36:39a
	Yes, I am.	10	1552	01:36:39b
	Hey, Tex?	09	1553	01:36:39c
	Come here.	10	1554	01:36:41a
	So, if you're both experienced riders,	38	1555	01:36:47a
	I guess we'll just make this ride about having fun.	51	1556	01:36:47b
	You ready to have some fun?	27	1557	01:36:48a
	So Pussycat brought back some guy with her.	43	1558	01:36:51a
	Gypsy wants you to go give him a look-see.	42	1559	01:36:53a
	Yeah.	05	1560	01:36:53b
	Sure thing.	11	1561	01:37:14a
	And here's someone you absolutely have to meet.	47	1562	01:37:17a
	One of our most favorite sons.	30	1563	01:37:19a
	Tex, come on over here and say hi to Cliff.	43	1564	01:37:22a
	Howdy, Cliff.	13	1565	01:37:22b
	Tex.	04	1566	01:37:24a
	What part of Texas you from?	28	1567	01:37:24b
	A place you never heard of.	27	1568	01:37:28a
	Copeville.	10	1569	01:37:29a
	Ever been to Houston?	21	1570	01:37:31a
	Course I have.	14	1571	01:37:33a
	Yeah, I spent two weeks once on a Houston chain gang.	53	1572	01:37:35a
	In August, no less.	19	1573	01:37:37a
	That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.	43	1574	01:37:40a
	It's the last cop's jaw I ever broke,	37	1575	01:37:49a
	I can tell you that.	20	1576	01:37:49b
	Charlie's gonna dig you.	24	1577	01:37:52a
	The Hawaiian guy seems to be okay.	34	1578	01:37:54a
	Everybody's talking all friendly.	33	1579	01:37:57a
	Enjoy your day.	15	1580	01:37:57b
	Thank you.	10	1581	01:37:59a
	Tex checked him out, and now he's riding away.	46	1582	01:38:03a
	If he comes this way, let me know.	34	1583	01:38:08a
	Hey, does George Spahn still own this ranch?	44	1584	01:38:10a
	Yeah, George still owns it.	27	1585	01:38:13a
	Does he still live here?	24	1586	01:38:13b
	Yeah.	05	1587	01:38:16a
	Does he still live right there?	31	1588	01:38:19a
	Yeah.	05	1589	01:38:20a
	Is he here now?	15	1590	01:38:21a
	I guess so.	11	1591	01:38:25a
	So George gave you all permission to be here?	45	1592	01:38:28a
	Course he did.	14	1593	01:38:30a
	And y'all take care of him?	27	1594	01:38:33a
	We take care of George.	23	1595	01:38:35a
	We love George.	15	1596	01:38:38a
	Well, is there anything wrong with me saying hello to an old friend?	68	1597	01:38:42a
	You can't see him right now.	28	1598	01:38:44a
	Why can't I see him right now?	30	1599	01:38:48a
	Because he's napping.	21	1600	01:38:51a
	This is his nap time.	21	1601	01:39:03a
	Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.	42	1602	01:39:07a
	You never know.	15	1603	01:39:09a
	He might have just woke up.	27	1604	01:39:20a
	The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.	39	1605	01:39:23a
	Okay, y'all, beat it.	21	1606	01:39:25a
	I'll handle this guy.	21	1607	01:39:31a
	Fine.	05	1608	01:40:17a
	You the mama bear?	18	1609	01:40:20a
	Can I help you?	15	1610	01:40:20b
	I hope so.	10	1611	01:40:23a
	I'm an old friend of George's.	30	1612	01:40:23b
	Thought I'd stop and say hello.	31	1613	01:40:26a
	That's very nice of you,	24	1614	01:40:29a
	but you picked the wrong time.	30	1615	01:40:29b
	George is taking a nap right now.	33	1616	01:40:31a
	That is unfortunate.	20	1617	01:40:33a
	Yes, it is.	11	1618	01:40:36a
	What's your name?	17	1619	01:40:36b
	Cliff Booth.	12	1620	01:40:39a
	How do you know George?	23	1621	01:40:40a
	I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.	43	1622	01:40:43a
	When was the last time you saw George?	38	1623	01:40:45a
	I'd say about...	16	1624	01:40:49a
	eight years ago.	16	1625	01:40:52a
	I'm sorry.	10	1626	01:40:54a
	I didn't realize the two of you were so close.	46	1627	01:40:56a
	When he wakes up, I'll let him know you came by.	48	1628	01:41:00a
	I'd really like to say a quick hello now while I'm here.	56	1629	01:41:04a
	Came a long ways.	17	1630	01:41:06a
	Don't know when I'll get back this way again.	45	1631	01:41:08a
	I understand, but I'm afraid that's impossible.	47	1632	01:41:12a
	Impossible?	11	1633	01:41:14a
	Why is that impossible?	23	1634	01:41:16a
	Me and George like to watch TV on Sunday night...	49	1635	01:41:18a
	F.B.I.	06	1636	01:41:18b
	and Bonanza.	12	1637	01:41:18c
	but George finds it hard to keep awake,	39	1638	01:41:24a
	so I make him nap so I don't get gypped out of my TV time.	58	1639	01:41:24b
	Ah.	03	1640	01:41:27a
	Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.	37	1641	01:41:31a
	With my own two eyes,	21	1642	01:41:36a
	I'm gonna get a good look at George.	36	1643	01:41:36b
	And this...	11	1644	01:41:39a
	ain't stopping me.	18	1645	01:41:44a
	Okay.	05	1646	01:41:46a
	Suit yourself.	14	1647	01:43:14a
	He back there?	14	1648	01:43:17a
	Door at the end of the hallway.	31	1649	01:43:20a
	You might have to shake him awake.	34	1650	01:43:22a
	I fucked his brains out this morning.	37	1651	01:43:29a
	He may be tired.	16	1652	01:43:42a
	Mr. Eight Years Ago?	20	1653	01:43:46a
	George is blind,	16	1654	01:44:15a
	so you'll probably have to tell him who you are.	48	1655	01:44:15b
	George, you awake?	18	1656	01:44:36a
	George?	07	1657	01:44:39a
	Jesus.	06	1658	01:44:50a
	Hi, George.	11	1659	01:44:50b
	Wait a minute.	14	1660	01:44:53a
	What's going on?	16	1661	01:44:53b
	Everything's all right.	23	1662	01:44:55a
	I'm sorry to disturb you.	25	1663	01:44:55b
	Who are you?	12	1664	01:44:58a
	It's Cliff Booth.	17	1665	01:45:00a
	Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doing.	54	1666	01:45:03a
	John Wilkes Booth?	18	1667	01:45:05a
	No, Cliff Booth.	16	1668	01:45:09a
	Who's that?	11	1669	01:45:10a
	I used to shoot Bounty Law here, George.	40	1670	01:45:13a
	I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.	33	1671	01:45:15a
	Who?	04	1672	01:45:15b
	Rick Dalton.	12	1673	01:45:18a
	The Dalton Brothers?	20	1674	01:45:19a
	No, Rick Dalton.	16	1675	01:45:23a
	Who's that?	11	1676	01:45:24a
	He was the star of Bounty Law.	30	1677	01:45:27a
	And who are you?	16	1678	01:45:29a
	I was Rick's stunt double.	26	1679	01:45:31a
	Rick who?	09	1680	01:45:33a
	It don't matter, George.	24	1681	01:45:35a
	We were colleagues from the past,	33	1682	01:45:40a
	and I just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.	49	1683	01:45:40b
	I'm not doing okay.	19	1684	01:45:40c
	What's the matter?	18	1685	01:45:43a
	Can't see shit.	15	1686	01:45:45a
	Would you call that the matter?	31	1687	01:45:46a
	The man can't see shit, okay?	29	1688	01:45:48a
	I know.	07	1689	01:45:48b
	I'm sorry about that.	21	1690	01:45:48c
	I was told.	11	1691	01:45:51a
	Squeaky sent me to bed.	23	1692	01:45:54a
	Would that be the little redhead out front?	43	1693	01:45:59a
	What the fuck is the matter with you?	37	1694	01:46:01a
	First you wake me up,	21	1695	01:46:08a
	and now you're pretending that I didn't tell you I was fucking blind.	69	1696	01:46:08b
	How am I gonna know what the hell color the head of the girl is that's with me all the time?	92	1697	01:46:14a
	Fair enough, George.	20	1698	01:46:19a
	No.	03	1699	01:46:19b
	Jesus Christ.	13	1700	01:46:19c
	Come on, George.	16	1701	01:46:19d
	All right.	10	1702	01:46:22a
	Everyone don't need a stuntman.	31	1703	01:46:32a
	I don't know who you are...	27	1704	01:46:37a
	but you touched me today.	25	1705	01:46:41a
	You came to visit me.	21	1706	01:46:43a
	Now I got to go back to sleep.	30	1707	01:46:48a
	I got to watch F.B.I.	21	1708	01:46:48b
	tonight.	08	1709	01:46:51a
	I watch it with Squeaky.	24	1710	01:46:54a
	She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.	41	1711	01:46:57a
	What happens when she gets pissed off, George?	46	1712	01:47:01a
	Nothing.	08	1713	01:47:04a
	I just don't like to disappoint her.	36	1714	01:47:11a
	So you gave all these hippies permission to be here?	52	1715	01:47:21a
	Just who the fuck are you?	26	1716	01:47:23a
	I'm Cliff Booth.	16	1717	01:47:25a
	I'm a stuntman.	15	1718	01:47:26a
	We used to work together, George.	33	1719	01:47:29a
	And I just want to make sure you're okay.	41	1720	01:47:32a
	And that all these hippies aren't taking advantage of you.	58	1721	01:47:35a
	Squeaky?	08	1722	01:47:35b
	Yeah.	05	1723	01:47:38a
	She loves me.	13	1724	01:47:43a
	So suck on that.	16	1725	01:47:53a
	You take care, George.	22	1726	01:48:02a
	Goddamn it.	11	1727	01:48:25a
	You embarrassed me.	19	1728	01:48:27a
	Yeah, sorry about that.	23	1729	01:48:32a
	How'd your little talk with George go?	38	1730	01:48:34a
	Are we kidnapping him?	22	1731	01:48:35a
	Not the word I'd use.	21	1732	01:48:37a
	Now you've talked to him,	25	1733	01:48:39a
	you believe everything's all right?	35	1734	01:48:39b
	Not exactly.	12	1735	01:48:41a
	This was a mistake.	19	1736	01:48:41b
	You should leave.	17	1737	01:48:43a
	Way ahead of you.	17	1738	01:48:49a
	George isn't blind.	19	1739	01:48:51a
	You're the blind one.	21	1740	01:49:38a
	You do that?	12	1741	01:49:45a
	You know, that's not my car.	28	1742	01:49:47a
	That's my boss's car.	21	1743	01:49:49a
	And if something were to happen to my boss's car,	49	1744	01:50:11a
	I'd get in trouble.	19	1745	01:50:11b
	Fix it.	07	1746	01:50:13a
	Fuck you.	09	1747	01:50:41a
	Leave him alone.	16	1748	01:50:41b
	He's a flower.	14	1749	01:50:43a
	He's a flower, man.	19	1750	01:50:45a
	He's just a flower.	19	1751	01:50:45b
	He doesn't know better.	23	1752	01:50:48a
	Ladies.	07	1753	01:50:55a
	Come one step closer and I will knock his teeth out.	52	1754	01:51:10a
	Fix it.	07	1755	01:51:12a
	Can I at least get a rag to wipe my face first?	47	1756	01:51:14a
	Nope.	05	1757	01:51:16a
	Tire first.	11	1758	01:51:27a
	Sundance.	09	1759	01:51:27b
	Yeah.	05	1760	01:51:29a
	Get on a horse,	15	1761	01:51:33a
	go get Tex and get his ass down here.	37	1762	01:51:33b
	Okay.	05	1763	01:51:43a
	I love you.	11	1764	01:52:09a
	Tex.	04	1765	01:52:09b
	That Hawaiian guy's back at the ranch kicking Clem's face in.	61	1766	01:52:15a
	Son of a...	11	1767	01:52:17a
	I'll take over for Tex.	23	1768	01:52:19a
	Right this way.	15	1769	01:52:47a
	Hyah.	05	1770	01:52:47b
	Clem, you all right?	20	1771	01:53:33a
	How do?	07	1772	01:53:35a
	What a day.	11	1773	01:53:35b
	Shit, I almost lost my shit.	28	1774	01:54:27a
	You, uh...	10	1775	01:54:28a
	You want to come in and watch my F.B.I.?	40	1776	01:54:30a
	Why, I just figured we would.	29	1777	01:54:30b
	I got a six-pack in the back.	29	1778	01:54:33a
	Thought we'd order a pizza.	27	1779	01:54:34a
	All right.	10	1780	01:54:36a
	Eighteen miles to Pendleton, Willard.	37	1781	01:55:01a
	Any kind of luck,	17	1782	01:55:10a
	we'll be unloaded and back at El Toro before my kids go to bed.	63	1783	01:55:10b
	Hey, bought me an acid-dipped cigarette today.	46	1784	01:55:14a
	Yeah?	05	1785	01:55:16a
	You want to buy a cigarette dipped in acid?	43	1786	01:55:18a
	Yeah.	05	1787	01:55:20a
	If I'm gonna trip, I want to trip here, man.	44	1788	01:55:22a
	Walk in the woods.	18	1789	01:55:22b
	Not in my home.	15	1790	01:55:26a
	Just gonna stash it here.	25	1791	01:55:27a
	Don't smoke it by mistake.	26	1792	01:55:27b
	Yeah.	05	1793	01:55:29a
	You want to smoke some, smoke some.	35	1794	01:55:29b
	Just save me some.	18	1795	01:55:32a
	I don't need to trip out on no acid.	36	1796	01:55:36a
	My booze don't need no buddy.	29	1797	01:55:38a
	Oh.	03	1798	01:55:39a
	Here I come.	12	1799	01:55:39b
	Mm.	03	1800	01:55:44a
	What's the trouble, corporal?	29	1801	01:55:46a
	There's a truck tailing us, sir.	32	1802	01:55:51a
	It might be a farmer in a hurry to get someplace.	49	1803	01:55:56a
	Fine.	05	1804	01:55:57a
	Well, take it as fast as you can.	33	1805	01:56:00a
	Yes, sir.	09	1806	01:56:04a
	That PCH?	09	1807	01:56:06a
	Yeah, yeah.	11	1808	01:56:06b
	Malibu.	07	1809	01:56:09a
	Puerco Canyon or some shit.	27	1810	01:56:09b
	I don't know.	13	1811	01:56:17a
	Uh-oh.	06	1812	01:56:17b
	Here comes trouble.	19	1813	01:56:23a
	Boom.	05	1814	01:56:23b
	Ha, ha.	07	1815	01:56:24a
	Man.	04	1816	01:56:24b
	Right in the face.	18	1817	01:56:38a
	That was a smooth leap.	23	1818	01:56:40a
	Thank you.	10	1819	01:56:44a
	Dead number two.	16	1820	01:56:53a
	I like that shot.	17	1821	01:56:55a
	That guy's a fucking prick.	27	1822	01:57:04a
	That's Bobby Hogan.	19	1823	01:57:04b
	Good guy.	09	1824	01:57:15a
	All right, get ready for my big F.B.I.	38	1825	01:57:15b
	moment.	07	1826	01:57:18a
	They're all dead, babe.	23	1827	01:57:18b
	Good.	05	1828	01:57:29a
	Michael Murtaugh.	17	1829	01:57:30a
	The F.B.I.	10	1830	01:57:30b
	Michael Murtaugh.	17	1831	01:57:32a
	Buongiorno, Sergio.	19	1832	01:57:34a
	Turn on Channel 7.	18	1833	01:57:36a
	ABC.	04	1834	01:57:37a
	F.B.I.	06	1835	01:57:39a
	I'm watching your Nebraska Jim as we speak.	43	1836	01:57:42a
	Philip Abbott, William Reynolds.	32	1837	01:57:47a
	With guest stars James Farentino, Rick Dalton...	48	1838	01:57:52a
	Like the chewing gum?	21	1839	01:57:54a
	Norman Fell.	12	1840	01:57:54b
	Strong.	07	1841	01:57:56a
	Tonight's episode.	18	1842	01:57:58a
	All the Streets Are Silent.	27	1843	01:58:00a
	Except when Rick Dalton's got a fucking shotgun,	48	1844	01:58:03a
	I'll tell you that.	19	1845	01:58:03b
	You're goddamn right.	21	1846	01:58:05a
	New Ford Cortina.	17	1847	01:58:27a
	Well, that looks delicious.	27	1848	01:58:28a
	Thank you.	10	1849	01:58:28b
	Enjoy, sir.	11	1850	01:58:30a
	Mm-mm-mm-mm...	14	1851	01:58:30b
	Mmm.	04	1852	01:58:36a
	After that Musso & Frank's lunch meeting,	41	1853	01:58:42a
	Marvin did provide Rick job opportunities in the Italian film industry.	71	1854	01:58:42b
	Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here.	33	1855	01:58:42c
	Hold on.	08	1856	01:58:46a
	Hennessy X.O on the rocks.	26	1857	01:58:48a
	Yes, Mr. Schwarz.	17	1858	01:58:49a
	Two words.	10	1859	01:58:51a
	Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.	30	1860	01:58:53a
	N-Nebraska what?	16	1861	01:58:55a
	Sergio who?	11	1862	01:58:56a
	Sergio Corbucci.	16	1863	01:58:58a
	A-and who's that?	17	1864	01:59:00a
	The second-best director of Spaghetti Westerns in the whole wide world.	71	1865	01:59:03a
	He's doing a new Western.	25	1866	01:59:03b
	It's called Nebraska Jim.	25	1867	01:59:07a
	And because of me, he's considering you.	40	1868	01:59:09a
	Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.	28	1869	01:59:12a
	And Rick made a rather compelling Nebraska Jim,	47	1870	01:59:21a
	existing quite nicely within Sergio Corbucci's rogues gallery of antiheroes.	76	1871	01:59:21b
	In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi and the fuss they made over him and his Nebraska Jim costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.	110	1872	01:59:28a
	All right there, paparazzos.	28	1873	01:59:28b
	All right.	10	1874	01:59:28c
	Take it easy.	13	1875	01:59:32a
	He loved the food so much that during his stay,	47	1876	01:59:36a
	Rick gained almost 15 pounds.	29	1877	01:59:36b
	But he didn't love the Italians' way of making movies.	54	1878	01:59:39a
	In fact, he thought the post-synced,	36	1879	01:59:48a
	every actor speaks their own language,	38	1880	01:59:48b
	Tower of Babel shooting style of European movies was ridiculous.	64	1881	01:59:48c
	While in Rome,	14	1882	01:59:52a
	Marvin plugged Rick into three other Italian productions.	57	1883	01:59:52b
	His second Western was Kill Me Quick,	37	1884	02:00:02a
	Ringo, Said the Gringo,	23	1885	02:00:02b
	also starring Joseph Cotten and directed by Calvin Jackson Padget,	66	1886	02:00:02c
	pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.	30	1887	02:00:02d
	His third was an Italian/Spanish coproduction that paired him with Telly Savalas,	81	1888	02:00:13a
	titled Red Blood,	17	1889	02:00:13b
	Red Skin, directed by Joaquín Romero Marchent and based on the Floyd Raye Wilson novel,	87	1890	02:00:13c
	The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian.	38	1891	02:00:17a
	And his fourth,	15	1892	02:01:07a
	a Spaghetti secret agent,	25	1893	02:01:07b
	James Bond rip-off-type flick called Operazione Dyn-O-Mite.,	60	1894	02:01:07c
	directed by Antonio Margheriti.	31	1895	02:01:07d
	Ultimately making Rick's six-month Italian sojourn fairly profitable,	69	1896	02:01:17a
	although his swank Roman apartment ate up a big chunk of his earnings.	70	1897	02:01:17b
	So as Rick returns to Hollywood via Pan Am,	43	1898	02:01:32a
	he has four new movies under his belt,	38	1899	02:01:32b
	some money in his pocket,	25	1900	02:01:32c
	and his brand-spanking-new Italian wife,	40	1901	02:01:32d
	starlet Francesca Cappucci.	27	1902	02:01:32e
	Hurtling through the air towards a new life and uncertain future,	65	1903	02:01:41a
	Rick was really not sure about what lay ahead for him.	54	1904	02:01:41b
	Way back in coach,	18	1905	02:01:50a
	working on his bottomless Bloody Mary,	38	1906	02:01:50b
	Cliff Booth returned to Los Angeles as well.	44	1907	02:01:50c
	He kept Rick company during his entire six-month stay in Italy.	63	1908	02:01:54a
	However, as the two men return home,	36	1909	02:02:00a
	they've come to an understanding.	33	1910	02:02:00b
	Well, here it goes now.	23	1911	02:02:02a
	With the, uh...	15	1912	02:02:05a
	With the new wife, I, uh...	27	1913	02:02:08a
	I just I can't afford you anymore, Cliff.	41	1914	02:02:11a
	You know?	09	1915	02:02:11b
	I can barely afford my own house anymore.	41	1916	02:02:15a
	So I think the plan is to sell the house and buy-buy a condo in-in-in Toluca Lake,	82	1917	02:02:21a
	bank the money.	15	1918	02:02:21b
	You know, live off it.	22	1919	02:02:21c
	That type of thing.	19	1920	02:02:24a
	Hopefully, I score come next pilot season.	42	1921	02:02:27a
	That's a good plan.	19	1922	02:02:28a
	Yeah.	05	1923	02:02:28b
	You know, by then,	18	1924	02:02:41a
	I'll know if I have a career or not,	36	1925	02:02:41b
	if I'm a solid Los Angeles citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,	59	1926	02:02:41c
	or if I'm one step closer to going back to Missouri.	52	1927	02:02:41d
	So when this whole European journey is over,	44	1928	02:02:48a
	I think we've, uh...	20	1929	02:02:48b
	We've reached the end of the trail, Cliff.	42	1930	02:03:01a
	So these last four Italian flicks,	34	1931	02:03:08a
	after nine years together,	26	1932	02:03:08b
	would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo.	38	1933	02:03:08c
	Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do.	45	1934	02:03:11a
	The only thing the two men know of for sure.	44	1935	02:03:13a
	Tonight, Rick and Cliff will have a good old-fashioned drunk.	61	1936	02:03:17a
	Both men know,	14	1937	02:03:23a
	once the plane touches down in El Segundo,	42	1938	02:03:23b
	it'll be the end of an era for both of them.	44	1939	02:03:23c
	And when you come to the end of the line with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife,	111	1940	02:04:29a
	getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewell.	68	1941	02:04:29b
	Here it is, honey.	18	1942	02:04:31a
	You like it?	12	1943	02:04:31b
	I love it.	10	1944	02:04:45a
	Where do you want it?	21	1945	02:04:50a
	Hello?	06	1946	02:04:52a
	Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.	30	1947	02:04:53a
	Hi.	03	1948	02:04:53b
	Come on up.	11	1949	02:05:01a
	Hi.	03	1950	02:05:02a
	Honey.	06	1951	02:05:02b
	How are you?	12	1952	02:05:05a
	My gosh, you're about to pop.	29	1953	02:05:05b
	I know.	07	1954	02:05:08a
	Oh.	03	1955	02:05:09a
	And this is the nursery.	24	1956	02:05:09b
	My God, Sharon.	15	1957	02:05:12a
	It's perfect.	13	1958	02:05:12b
	Do you love it?	15	1959	02:05:14a
	Little shoes.	13	1960	02:05:15a
	I know.	07	1961	02:05:18a
	I'm about to burst.	19	1962	02:05:20a
	I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.	43	1963	02:05:20b
	Thank you.	10	1964	02:05:26a
	Mm.	03	1965	02:05:39a
	Thanks, Gillian.	16	1966	02:05:39b
	Bye.	04	1967	02:05:41a
	Bye, Brandy.	12	1968	02:05:47a
	Sharon had two friends move into the Cielo Drive residence while Roman was in London preparing his next movie.	110	1969	02:05:53a
	Voytek Frykowski,	17	1970	02:06:43a
	an old friend of Roman's from Poland,	37	1971	02:06:43b
	and his girlfriend,	19	1972	02:06:43c
	social worker Abigail Folger,	29	1973	02:06:43d
	heiress to the vast Folger coffee empire.	41	1974	02:06:43e
	That night, Sharon,	19	1975	02:06:47a
	her two houseguests and,	24	1976	02:06:47b
	all went to the West Hollywood Mexican restaurant landmark El Coyote,	69	1977	02:06:57a
	on Beverly, for dinner.	23	1978	02:06:57b
	What's going on at the dirty movie place?	41	1979	02:06:59a
	They're having a premiere.	26	1980	02:07:01a
	Dirty movies have premieres?	28	1981	02:07:03a
	Yeah.	05	1982	02:07:03b
	They're fun.	12	1983	02:07:05a
	This place is always so busy.	29	1984	02:07:05b
	I know.	07	1985	02:07:07a
	It's crazy in here.	19	1986	02:07:14a
	And right here for you.	23	1987	02:07:17a
	Gentlemen.	10	1988	02:07:17b
	Thanks.	07	1989	02:07:21a
	While closer to 8.30,	21	1990	02:07:32a
	Rick and Cliff went to the Valley Mexican restaurant landmark Casa Vega on Ventura.	83	1991	02:07:32b
	Hello.	06	1992	02:07:32c
	Welcome.	08	1993	02:07:35a
	You're welcome, sir.	20	1994	02:07:48a
	Well, if it ain't the cobra himself.	36	1995	02:07:50a
	Hey, Doug.	10	1996	02:07:50b
	What's happening?	17	1997	02:07:50c
	How you doing?	14	1998	02:07:53a
	It's good to see you.	21	1999	02:07:53b
	How's the wife?	15	2000	02:07:55a
	I'm just kidding.	17	2001	02:07:55b
	Brandy stayed behind at Rick's house,	37	2002	02:08:09a
	guarding the beautiful Italian woman asleep in her bed and waiting for Cliff and Rick to come home...	101	2003	02:08:09b
	while jet-lagged Francesca slept.	33	2004	02:08:15a
	But you just get paid for the day that you cut his hair?	56	2005	02:08:17a
	No, no, no.	11	2006	02:08:18a
	I get paid $1000 a day.	23	2007	02:08:20a
	I get paid $1000 the day I arrive.	34	2008	02:08:22a
	I get paid $1000...	19	2009	02:08:22b
	At El Coyote, margaritas and good times were had by all,	56	2010	02:08:28a
	Sharon was experiencing a touch of pregnancy-induced melancholy.	64	2011	02:08:32a
	Not only that,	14	2012	02:08:40a
	it was later reported that it was the hottest night of the year,	64	2013	02:08:40b
	and it made her feel especially pregnant in all the worst ways.	63	2014	02:08:40c
	I don't want to party anymore.	30	2015	02:08:40d
	I am tired.	11	2016	02:08:42a
	Because he got it done.	23	2017	02:08:44a
	No, it's not...	15	2018	02:08:44b
	It's not because he just got it done.	37	2019	02:08:47a
	He had just as much time as all the rest of the goddamn directors.	66	2020	02:08:50a
	What he did with that time...	29	2021	02:08:50b
	That's what counted.	20	2022	02:08:52a
	At Casa Vega, Rick and Cliff drank so much that,	48	2023	02:08:58a
	when they left,	15	2024	02:08:58b
	they left the Cadillac there and took a cab home.	49	2025	02:08:58c
	The greatest action director,	29	2026	02:09:03a
	underrated guy of all time.	27	2027	02:09:03b
	Around 10, Sharon and her friends left El Coyote and arrived back at her house.	79	2028	02:09:17a
	You've had, like, 19 margaritas.	32	2029	02:09:23a
	The four of them hung out a little longer,	42	2030	02:10:03a
	with Abigail even playing the piano for them...	47	2031	02:10:03b
	until she returned to her room,	31	2032	02:10:07a
	smoked a joint and read a book.	31	2033	02:10:07b
	That was around 11.	19	2034	02:10:28a
	At more or less the same time,	30	2035	02:10:39a
	Voytek laid on the couch watching American television and thought about how much better it was than Polish television,	118	2036	02:10:39b
	as he smoked a big joint.	25	2037	02:10:39c
	Somewhere around 11.10,	23	2038	02:10:43a
	Sharon changed into her comfy house attire.	43	2039	02:10:43b
	Feel better?	12	2040	02:10:45a
	That is drastically better.	27	2041	02:10:49a
	It was after 11.45 by the time the yellow cab dropped Rick and Cliff in front of the house.	91	2042	02:10:55a
	Thank you.	10	2043	02:10:55b
	Right here.	11	2044	02:10:57a
	All right.	10	2045	02:10:57b
	Grazie, amigo.	14	2046	02:11:00a
	How much do I owe you?	22	2047	02:11:00b
	Three dollars.	14	2048	02:11:03a
	Brandy was glad to see them return.	35	2049	02:11:05a
	Thank you, brother.	19	2050	02:11:05b
	Thanks.	07	2051	02:11:07a
	More margaritas.	16	2052	02:11:14a
	Around midnight,	16	2053	02:11:23a
	a completely drunk Rick Dalton started making a blender of frozen margaritas.	77	2054	02:11:23b
	All right.	10	2055	02:11:26a
	We're walking.	14	2056	02:11:26b
	At the same time,	17	2057	02:11:31a
	Cliff was attaching a leash to an excited Brandy's dog collar.	62	2058	02:11:31b
	I know.	07	2059	02:11:38a
	I remember you.	15	2060	02:11:40a
	A cigarette dipped in acid.	27	2061	02:11:42a
	What's that do?	15	2062	02:11:42b
	You smoke it.	13	2063	02:11:42c
	It gets you high.	17	2064	02:11:44a
	How much?	09	2065	02:11:44b
	Fifty cents.	12	2066	02:11:48a
	Hippie girl, 50 cents.	22	2067	02:11:55a
	Tonight the night?	18	2068	02:11:58a
	Why not?	08	2069	02:12:23a
	And away we go.	15	2070	02:12:27a
	Our Polish friend said it was the hottest day of the year.	58	2071	02:12:31a
	Despite the fact that he said it,	33	2072	02:13:56a
	actually, it might be true.	27	2073	02:13:56b
	Goddamn.	08	2074	02:13:59a
	Fucking private road.	21	2075	02:14:01a
	Damn property taxes up the butt.	32	2076	02:14:03a
	Goddamn.	08	2077	02:14:12a
	Bunch of goddamn fucking hippies.	33	2078	02:14:16a
	What the fuck?	14	2079	02:14:21a
	Hey, you.	09	2080	02:14:24a
	Yeah, asshole, I'm talking to you.	34	2081	02:14:28a
	What the hell do you think you're doing bringing that noisy hunk of shit around here at midnight?	97	2082	02:14:33a
	This is a private road, all right?	34	2083	02:14:36a
	Who are you?	12	2084	02:14:36b
	And who are you here to see?	28	2085	02:14:39a
	Nobody, sir.	12	2086	02:14:39b
	We just got lost and a little turned around.	44	2087	02:14:42a
	Horseshit.	10	2088	02:14:45a
	You fucking hippies came up here to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?	67	2089	02:14:49a
	Next time you want to try that,	31	2090	02:14:52a
	fix your fucking muffler.	25	2091	02:14:52b
	Look, we're really sorry we disturbed you.	42	2092	02:14:54a
	Look, chief, you don't belong here.	35	2093	02:14:56a
	Now, take this mechanical asshole and get it off my fucking street.	67	2094	02:15:14a
	Hey.	04	2095	02:15:15a
	Dennis Hopper.	14	2096	02:15:15b
	Move this fucking piece of shit.	32	2097	02:15:18a
	All right.	10	2098	02:15:18b
	Just give me a moment to turn it around.	40	2099	02:15:21a
	Drive it backwards,	19	2100	02:15:25a
	numbnuts, but fucking drive it,	31	2101	02:15:25b
	and drive it now.	17	2102	02:15:25c
	Okay.	05	2103	02:15:25d
	Stop yelling.	13	2104	02:15:26a
	Hold your horses.	17	2105	02:15:26b
	We're leaving.	14	2106	02:15:32a
	The hell are you looking at,	28	2107	02:15:36a
	you little ginger-haired fucker?	32	2108	02:15:36b
	Hey, you come around here again,	32	2109	02:15:45a
	I'm gonna call the fucking cops.	32	2110	02:15:45b
	Dirty fucking hippies.	22	2111	02:16:00a
	There in his fancy fucking house,	33	2112	02:16:03a
	thinking he's handled it.	25	2113	02:16:03b
	But he's seen us.	17	2114	02:16:03c
	He's awake.	11	2115	02:16:03d
	He's alert.	11	2116	02:16:06a
	They're all awake.	18	2117	02:16:06b
	They're listening to fucking records.	37	2118	02:16:09a
	Everybody's fucking awake.	26	2119	02:16:11a
	Look.	05	2120	02:16:12a
	What did Charlie say?	21	2121	02:16:15a
	Go to Terry's old house and kill everybody in there.	52	2122	02:16:19a
	And you heard him yourself.	27	2123	02:16:19b
	He said, Make it witchy.	24	2124	02:16:23a
	Now, he either said that, or I'm a liar.	40	2125	02:16:29a
	Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?	42	2126	02:16:33a
	Hm?	03	2127	02:16:35a
	How about you?	14	2128	02:16:37a
	Are you calling me a liar?	26	2129	02:16:40a
	No, of course not.	18	2130	02:16:42a
	Good.	05	2131	02:16:43a
	Hold it.	08	2132	02:16:44a
	Was that Rick Dalton?	21	2133	02:16:44b
	Who?	04	2134	02:16:47a
	The guy from Bounty Law.	24	2135	02:16:48a
	Who, Jake Cahill?	17	2136	02:16:48b
	Yeah.	05	2137	02:16:50a
	That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.	37	2138	02:16:53a
	Wait a minute.	14	2139	02:16:53b
	That was fucking Jake Cahill that just yelled at me?	52	2140	02:16:57a
	He was older, but, yeah, I think so.	36	2141	02:16:59a
	So who's this Rick guy?	23	2142	02:17:00a
	Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.	37	2143	02:17:02a
	Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a cowboy show in the '50s called Bounty Law.	78	2144	02:17:06a
	Fuck you, Katie.	16	2145	02:17:08a
	Sorry I don't know the name of every fascist on TV in the '50s.	63	2146	02:17:11a
	I can't believe that asshole in the robe was Jake Cahill.	57	2147	02:17:15a
	When I was a kid, I had a Bounty Law lunch box.	47	2148	02:17:18a
	That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes.	43	2149	02:17:22a
	Dig this.	09	2150	02:17:25a
	When we've been having our trip sessions,	41	2151	02:17:29a
	I've been expanding on this one idea in my head.	48	2152	02:17:29b
	All right, dig it.	18	2153	02:17:31a
	We all grew up watching TV, you know what I mean?	49	2154	02:17:35a
	And if you grew up watching TV,	31	2155	02:17:38a
	that means you grew up watching murder.	39	2156	02:17:38b
	Mm-hm.	06	2157	02:17:39a
	Every show on TV that wasn't I Love Lucy was about murder.	58	2158	02:17:44a
	So my idea is...	16	2159	02:17:47a
	we kill the people who taught us to kill.	41	2160	02:17:52a
	I mean, where the fuck are we, man?	35	2161	02:17:53a
	We are in fucking Hollywood, man.	33	2162	02:17:56a
	The people an entire generation grew up watching kill people live here.	71	2163	02:18:00a
	And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury.	41	2164	02:18:02a
	I say fuck them.	16	2165	02:18:03a
	I say we cut their cocks off and make them eat it.	50	2166	02:18:06a
	That's a great idea, Sadie.	27	2167	02:18:11a
	You two ready to kill some piggies?	35	2168	02:18:22a
	Wait a minute.	14	2169	02:18:22b
	Shit.	05	2170	02:18:24a
	Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car.	36	2171	02:18:27a
	Can I go...?	12	2172	02:18:27b
	Can I go back and get it?	25	2173	02:18:30a
	Yeah, sure.	11	2174	02:18:30b
	Okay.	05	2175	02:18:31a
	Go on.	06	2176	02:18:31b
	Wait a minute.	14	2177	02:18:31c
	What?	05	2178	02:18:33a
	I locked the car.	17	2179	02:18:33b
	You'll need keys to get in.	27	2180	02:18:38a
	Oh.	03	2181	02:18:39a
	Right.	06	2182	02:18:39b
	Thank you.	10	2183	02:18:41a
	Okay.	05	2184	02:18:41b
	I'll be right back.	19	2185	02:18:41c
	Okay.	05	2186	02:18:44a
	Just hurry up.	14	2187	02:18:44b
	Yeah, just a little minute.	27	2188	02:18:57a
	That fucking bitch.	19	2189	02:18:59a
	Shh.	04	2190	02:18:59b
	Calm down.	10	2191	02:19:00a
	There's a fucking house right there.	36	2192	02:19:03a
	What do we do now?	18	2193	02:19:05a
	We do what we came to do.	25	2194	02:19:06a
	And when we're done, we split up and hitch home.	48	2195	02:19:09a
	Any more questions?	19	2196	02:19:10a
	Hm?	03	2197	02:19:14a
	Okay, pig killers, let's kill some piggies.	43	2198	02:19:16a
	All right.	10	2199	02:19:30a
	Someone's hungry.	17	2200	02:19:41a
	All right.	10	2201	02:19:44a
	It's feeding time.	18	2202	02:19:49a
	Brandy, couch.	14	2203	02:19:57a
	And don't you mo...	19	2204	02:20:06a
	Man.	04	2205	02:20:18a
	The train has left the station.	31	2206	02:20:27a
	Bad idea.	09	2207	02:21:28a
	Whoa.	05	2208	02:22:17a
	You go around there,	20	2209	02:22:21a
	see if there's a back entrance.	31	2210	02:22:21b
	All right?	10	2211	02:22:21c
	Go.	03	2212	02:23:09a
	Hey.	04	2213	02:23:14a
	I am doing the best I can under the circumstances.	50	2214	02:23:18a
	Now, I do not want to get into it tonight.	42	2215	02:23:30a
	Can I help you?	15	2216	02:23:39a
	Shit.	05	2217	02:23:41a
	How many other people are here?	31	2218	02:23:43a
	Just the one sleeping in the back there.	40	2219	02:23:47a
	Go get him and bring him into the living room.	46	2220	02:23:50a
	What if he says no?	19	2221	02:23:52a
	Don't take no for an answer.	28	2222	02:23:53a
	You're the one with the knife.	30	2223	02:23:53b
	Get him in here.	16	2224	02:23:58a
	Hey.	04	2225	02:24:05a
	You are real, right?	20	2226	02:24:07a
	I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.	40	2227	02:24:19a
	What the fuck?	14	2228	02:24:28a
	Go to the living room.	22	2229	02:24:29a
	What is going on, huh?	22	2230	02:24:36a
	Go.	03	2231	02:24:36b
	Okay.	05	2232	02:24:36c
	Si, si.	07	2233	02:24:40a
	Who the fuck's that?	20	2234	02:24:41a
	I don't know.	13	2235	02:24:44a
	Francesca.	10	2236	02:24:51a
	What...?	08	2237	02:24:56a
	I know you.	11	2238	02:24:58a
	I know all three of you.	24	2239	02:25:01a
	Yeah.	05	2240	02:25:01b
	Spahn Ranch.	12	2241	02:25:04a
	Yeah.	05	2242	02:25:04b
	Hoo.	04	2243	02:25:08a
	I don't know your name, but I remember that hair.	49	2244	02:25:12a
	And you, I remember your white little face.	43	2245	02:25:16a
	And you were on a horsie.	25	2246	02:25:18a
	Yeah.	05	2247	02:25:19a
	You are...?	11	2248	02:25:23a
	I'm the devil,	14	2249	02:25:31a
	and I'm here to do the devil's business.	40	2250	02:25:31b
	It was dumber than that.	24	2251	02:25:31c
	Something like...	17	2252	02:25:31d
	Rex.	04	2253	02:25:34a
	God, shoot him, Tex.	20	2254	02:25:34b
	Tex.	04	2255	02:25:40a
	Fuck.	05	2256	02:25:56a
	Son of a bitch.	15	2257	02:26:36a
	Hey, you.	09	2258	02:26:40a
	How dare you come into my house, motherfucker.	46	2259	02:27:08a
	Man.	04	2260	02:28:03a
	What the fuck?	14	2261	02:28:06a
	Jesus Christ.	13	2262	02:29:24a
	Holy shit.	10	2263	02:29:29a
	Francesca.	10	2264	02:29:29b
	Francesca, honey.	17	2265	02:29:51a
	10,000 block, Cielo Drive.	26	2266	02:29:53a
	Around what time was it when you confronted the intruder?	57	2267	02:29:56a
	It was about midnight.	22	2268	02:29:58a
	Around midnight?	16	2269	02:29:58b
	Yeah.	05	2270	02:29:59a
	How do you know it was midnight?	32	2271	02:30:01a
	Well, I was, uh...	18	2272	02:30:01b
	I was in the kitchen.	21	2273	02:30:04a
	You know, I was making margaritas, and, uh...	45	2274	02:30:08a
	I heard the sound of a noisy muffler.	37	2275	02:30:09a
	I looked up at the clock.	25	2276	02:30:11a
	It said...	10	2277	02:30:11b
	The kitchen clock said midnight.	32	2278	02:30:13a
	Twelve o'clock exactly?	23	2279	02:30:15a
	I mean, it could have been 12.05.	33	2280	02:30:17a
	Something like that.	20	2281	02:30:17b
	And you didn't see them again until the woman attacked you in the pool.	71	2282	02:30:22a
	No, no.	07	2283	02:30:24a
	So, what did these perpetrators do?	35	2284	02:30:26a
	Perpetrators?	13	2285	02:30:26b
	They were hippie assholes.	26	2286	02:30:29a
	Two of them burst through the front door there,	47	2287	02:30:37a
	and the guy hippie said he was the devil.	41	2288	02:30:37b
	And he said, I'm here to...	27	2289	02:30:40a
	do some devil shit.	19	2290	02:30:42a
	That's not verbatim, but...	27	2291	02:30:45a
	Some devil shit?	16	2292	02:30:45b
	Yeah, devil shit.	17	2293	02:31:02a
	And away we go.	15	2294	02:31:07a
	Hey.	04	2295	02:31:07b
	Wait a minute.	14	2296	02:31:07c
	What hospital you going to, Cliff?	34	2297	02:31:11a
	I'll meet you there, huh?	25	2298	02:31:12a
	You don't want to meet me in no hospital.	41	2299	02:31:15a
	Why don't you go take care of your lady.	40	2300	02:31:17a
	Hey, she just took five fucking sleeping pills.	47	2301	02:31:20a
	She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.	35	2302	02:31:22a
	These guys will probably have to come out here again just to wake her ass up.	77	2303	02:31:24a
	Hey, I'm not gonna die.	23	2304	02:31:27a
	I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.	40	2305	02:31:29a
	It's not my time yet, man.	26	2306	02:31:29b
	All right.	10	2307	02:31:31a
	So no use waiting in some waiting room.	39	2308	02:31:33a
	Why don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.	51	2309	02:31:36a
	Come visit me tomorrow.	23	2310	02:31:38a
	Bring bagels.	13	2311	02:31:40a
	You want to do something for me, check on Brandy.	49	2312	02:31:43a
	She may be a little shook up after that.	40	2313	02:31:45a
	She may want to sleep with you.	31	2314	02:31:45b
	Are you kidding me?	19	2315	02:31:47a
	She's sleeping with Francesca right now.	40	2316	02:31:49a
	You might never get her back.	29	2317	02:31:49b
	Ha, ha.	07	2318	02:31:51a
	We got to go.	13	2319	02:31:51b
	All right, then, Cliff.	23	2320	02:31:53a
	I'll see you tomorrow, then.	28	2321	02:31:59a
	Hey.	04	2322	02:31:59b
	You're a good friend, Cliff.	28	2323	02:32:08a
	I try.	06	2324	02:32:41a
	Hello?	06	2325	02:32:44a
	Hey.	04	2326	02:32:45a
	I'm Jay Sebring.	16	2327	02:32:46a
	I'm a friend of the Polanskis.	30	2328	02:32:48a
	You're Rick Dalton, right?	26	2329	02:32:51a
	Yeah.	05	2330	02:32:51b
	I'm Rick Dalton.	16	2331	02:32:55a
	Live next door.	15	2332	02:32:55b
	I know.	07	2333	02:32:57a
	I tease Sharon that she lives next door to Jake Cahill.	55	2334	02:33:00a
	If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman,	43	2335	02:33:05a
	she just has to go next door, right?	36	2336	02:33:05b
	No shit.	08	2337	02:33:07a
	What the fuck happened?	23	2338	02:33:09a
	Th-these fucking hippie weirdos,	32	2339	02:33:14a
	they-they-they broke into my house.	35	2340	02:33:14b
	What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?	42	2341	02:33:17a
	We don't know what the fuck they wanted.	40	2342	02:33:19a
	Were they robbing me?	21	2343	02:33:19b
	I don't know.	13	2344	02:33:21a
	Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?	43	2345	02:33:23a
	Who knows?	10	2346	02:33:23b
	But they tried to kill my wife and my buddy.	44	2347	02:33:27a
	Jesus Christ.	13	2348	02:33:27b
	Are you serious?	16	2349	02:33:27c
	Yeah, I'm fucking serious.	26	2350	02:33:30a
	Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them,	45	2351	02:33:34a
	Well, shit.	11	2352	02:33:34b
	I torched the last one.	23	2353	02:33:37a
	Torched?	08	2354	02:33:37b
	Yeah.	05	2355	02:33:39a
	I burnt her ass to a crisp.	27	2356	02:33:41a
	How'd you do that?	18	2357	02:33:41b
	Well, believe it or not, I...	29	2358	02:33:44a
	I got a flamethrower in my toolshed.	36	2359	02:33:47a
	From	04	2360	02:33:47b
	The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.	32	2361	02:33:49a
	Yeah.	05	2362	02:33:51a
	That's...	09	2363	02:33:53a
	That's the one.	15	2364	02:33:55a
	Yeah, it still works too.	25	2365	02:33:55b
	Thank God.	10	2366	02:33:58a
	Is everybody okay?	18	2367	02:33:59a
	Well, the fucking hippies aren't,	33	2368	02:34:04a
	that's for goddamn sure.	24	2369	02:34:04b
	Yeah.	05	2370	02:34:04c
	But I'm fine.	13	2371	02:34:05a
	You know, my wife's fine.	25	2372	02:34:07a
	We're just a little shook up, is all.	37	2373	02:34:10a
	My God, that's terrifying.	26	2374	02:34:10b
	Yeah.	05	2375	02:34:14a
	Jay, honey, is everything all right?	36	2376	02:34:17a
	Everything's okay now, honey.	29	2377	02:34:19a
	But some hippies broke into the house next door.	48	2378	02:34:22a
	My God.	07	2379	02:34:24a
	That's terrifying.	18	2380	02:34:26a
	Is everybody okay?	18	2381	02:34:27a
	I'm talking to your next-door neighbor about it right now.	58	2382	02:34:31a
	Rick Dalton?	12	2383	02:34:34a
	Yeah, that's me.	16	2384	02:34:34b
	Heh.	04	2385	02:34:37a
	Well, hello, neighbor.	22	2386	02:34:40a
	Is everybody okay?	18	2387	02:34:42a
	Yes, Sharon, everybody's fine.	30	2388	02:34:45a
	Are you okay?	13	2389	02:34:49a
	Well, yes, I am.	16	2390	02:34:49b
	Thank you for asking that.	26	2391	02:34:52a
	Rick, would you like to come up to the house for a drink and meet my other friends?	83	2392	02:35:03a
	Yeah, sure.	11	2393	02:35:03b
	Thank you.	10	2394	02:35:06a
	Hooray.	07	2395	02:35:06b
	Great.	06	2396	02:35:06c
	I'll buzz you up.	17	2397	02:35:20a
	Come on.	08	2398	02:35:25a
	Hey, nice to meet you, huh?	27	2399	02:35:25b
	Yeah.	05	2400	02:35:27a
	Jay Sebring.	12	2401	02:35:27b
	Hey, pleasure.	14	2402	02:35:29a
	Yeah.	05	2403	02:35:29b
	Pleasure, Jay.	14	2404	02:35:30a
	Pleasure's all mine.	20	2405	02:35:31a
	Sounds like you had a hell of a night.	38	2406	02:38:52a
	Hi.	03	2407	02:38:52b
	This is Rick Dalton,	20	2408	02:39:00a
	better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,	42	2409	02:39:00b
	speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.	43	2410	02:39:00c
	Now, I smoke Red Apples.	24	2411	02:39:00d
	Been smoking them for years.	28	2412	02:39:03a
	But since the Red Apple tobacco company's been around since 1862,	65	2413	02:39:12a
	you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.	43	2414	02:39:12b
	Now, back in Jake's day,	24	2415	02:39:17a
	Red Apple came in a pouch,	26	2416	02:39:17b
	and he had to roll his own.	27	2417	02:39:17c
	But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.	42	2418	02:39:20a
	For the best drag with the best tobacco flavor,	47	2419	02:39:35a
	with less burn on your throat than any other non-filtered cigarette.	68	2420	02:39:35b
	Mm.	03	2421	02:39:38a
	Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.	45	2422	02:39:40a
	Hm.	03	2423	02:39:41a
	Better drag, more flavor, less throat burn.	43	2424	02:39:48a
	That's the Red Apple way.	25	2425	02:39:51a
	So look for this life-size standee of me,	41	2426	02:39:58a
	Jake Cahill, wherever fine Red Apple tobacco products are sold.	63	2427	02:39:58b
	Take a bite and feel all right.	31	2428	02:40:02a
	Take a bite of a Red Apple.	27	2429	02:40:05a
	Tell them Jake sent you.	24	2430	02:40:10a
	And cut.	08	2431	02:40:11a
	This cigarette tastes like fucking shit.	40	2432	02:40:13a
	And, by the way, who chose this photo?	38	2433	02:40:15a
	I have a double chin.	21	2434	02:40:15b
	All right?	10	2435	02:40:16a
	Nobody notices that crap?	25	2436	02:40:16b
