<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.827
<i>and this man's
going to collect.</i>

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.328
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:44.830
<i>and he lives by...</i>

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:46.665
Bounty Law.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.501
You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:52.004
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:58.677
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:00.179
I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.681
about to get his jaw busted.

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:04.892
Amateurs try
and take men in alive.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:09.146
Amateurs usually
don't make it.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.148
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:14.818
<i>you're just a dollar sign

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.529
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.</i>

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:22.910
Hello, everybody.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:24.203
This is Allen Kincade

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:26.246
on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:28.749
<i>and Screen Gems television
series Bounty Law.</i>

00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:30.709
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.336
don't adjust
your television sets

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.546
because, well,
in a way, you are.

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.507
<i>To my right
is Bounty Law series lead</i>

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:38.842
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.720
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:43.597
Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:46.058
- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:47.976
So, Rick,
explain to the audience

00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:50.437
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:52.898
Well...

00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:56.068
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:59.113
Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:01.448
Now, can I fall off
a horse?

00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:04.243
Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:10.541
But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.084
or I... or I
twist my ankle.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.212
Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.423
because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.259
So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:22.761
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:26.014
What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.896
<i>Join me next week on the set
of The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:34.898
where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:36.608
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:39.987
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:58.690
Hi. I missed you.

00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.780
The black one.
And the flowers.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:06.240
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:07.741
And there's the small one.

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.159
Can I see your tickets?

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.745
Oh, good boy.

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.766
Gina, Gina, Gina.

00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:15.559
The face
in the misty light.

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:18.645
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:22.775
I, uh... I have a meeting
with a very handsome cowboy man.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.902
He's waiting
for you in the bar.

00:05:25.652 --> 00:05:26.528
Ah.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.155
Well...

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.032
since I just finished
watching

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:32.326
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.120
I think I know who you are.
Put it there.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:37.706
Well, it's my pleasure,
Mr. Schwartz.

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:39.625
And thank you
for taking an interest.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.293
<i>Schwarz, not Schwartz.</i>

00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:44.296
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.466
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:49.176
Marvin, call me Rick.

00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:50.636
- Rick?
- Yeah.

00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:52.763
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:55.307
No, that's my stunt double,
Cliff Booth. Yeah.

00:05:55.432 --> 00:05:57.184
- Good to meet you.
- We've worked together

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.186
<i>since the last two seasons
of Bounty Law.</i>

00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:00.521
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:01.980
so he gave me a ride.

00:06:02.106 --> 00:06:03.649
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

00:06:03.774 --> 00:06:05.609
<i>Rick got his driver's license
taken away</i>

00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:07.319
<i>for too many
drunk-driving tickets.</i>

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:08.904
<i>Cliff drives him
everywhere now.</i>

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.155
Oh, fuck.

00:06:10.322 --> 00:06:11.782
Well, sounds
like a good friend.

00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:13.826
- I try.
- Mm.

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:16.620
I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:18.622
<i>Mary Alice Schwarz.</i>

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.166
Oh, well, that's nice.

00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:24.670
Thanks a lot.

00:06:26.463 --> 00:06:29.758
We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:31.552
in our screening room
last night.

00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:35.848
Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:37.558
What'd you see?

00:06:37.683 --> 00:06:40.561
<i>Thirty-five mm prints
of Tanner</i>

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:43.021
<i>and The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:52.489
I hope the, uh,
Rick Dalton double feature

00:06:52.614 --> 00:06:55.701
wasn't too painful for you
and the... And the missus.

00:06:55.826 --> 00:06:59.830
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.
What are you saying?

00:07:01.498 --> 00:07:03.042
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:05.044
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.754
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.048
<i>And we thoroughly
enjoyed Tanner.</i>

00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:10.466
Oh, that's nice.

00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:12.718
It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

00:07:12.843 --> 00:07:15.888
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

00:07:16.013 --> 00:07:22.352
<i>I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...</i>

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.938
<i>The Fourteen Fists

00:07:25.064 --> 00:07:26.690
What a picture.

00:07:26.857 --> 00:07:28.567
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:30.486
That is so much fun.

00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:31.612
All the shooting.

00:07:35.282 --> 00:07:37.326
I love that stuff.
You know, the killing.

00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.411
A lot of killing.
Lot of killing, yeah.

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:43.248
Now, gentlemen,
the plan is, we reverse our forces

00:07:43.374 --> 00:07:46.377
<i>und drive the Allies
back into the sea!</i>

00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:50.422
Genius.

00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:52.216
Panzer divisions come in,

00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.885
and we drive them here
to the ocean.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.387
They'll be up against
the wall.

00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:58.555
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:00.933
This is the spot...

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:03.268
Hermann!

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:06.313
Open the curtains.

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:29.128
Anybody order
fried sauerkraut?

00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:49.440
Burn, you Nazi bastards!
Ha-ha-ha!

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:53.485
That's you operating
the flamethrower, isn't it?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.487
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was. Yeah.

00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:57.406
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:59.575
that-that's one shit-fuck
crazy weapon

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.869
y-y-you do not wanna be
on the wrong side of.

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:03.370
Boy, oh, boy.

00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.290
You know, I practiced
with that dragon, uh,

00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.167
three hours a day
for two weeks.

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:10.044
Not just because
I wanted to look good

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:11.795
in the picture,
but because I was...

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.006
I was shit-scared
of the thing, to be honest.

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:16.550
Mike fucking Lewis!

00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:18.218
Crisping them Nazis
to hell!

00:09:18.343 --> 00:09:19.887
Oh, shit, that's...

00:09:20.012 --> 00:09:21.513
All right,
that's too hot.

00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:23.640
Anything we can do
about that heat?

00:09:23.807 --> 00:09:26.393
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

00:09:26.518 --> 00:09:29.730
So I came to the office
early today,

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:35.402
<i>and I watched two episodes
of Bounty Law on 16 mm.</i>

00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:37.237
Jody Janice,

00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:39.740
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:43.077
$425 dead or alive.

00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:46.663
And you brought him here
to collect.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.416
I don't even know
where here is.

00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:51.627
It was just
the closest place.

00:09:51.752 --> 00:09:54.546
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.632
So, bounty killer,

00:09:56.757 --> 00:10:00.135
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:04.181
And that boy you killed...

00:10:04.348 --> 00:10:07.559
was Jody Janice.

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:11.730
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:13.690
Hmm.

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:17.694
Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.200
Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:25.452
when he gets here.

on episodic TV shows
the last couple of years?

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:32.770
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot
f-for CBS right now.

00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:35.314
<i>It's called... It's called
Lancer. I play the heavy.</i>

<i>Did a, ahem,
Ron Ely Tarzan.</i>

00:11:38.108 --> 00:11:40.986
<i>I did a Land of the Giants.
Green Hornet.</i>

00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:42.988

- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.254

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.006
Well, not... Not...

- And you lose in the fight?

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:10.307
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I'm... I'm the heavy.

00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:14.561
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:16.563
<i>Now, you take Bingo Martin,
for example.</i>

00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:18.190
- Mm-hm.
- Right?

00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:21.193
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:24.363
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:26.699
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.367
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

00:12:28.492 --> 00:12:31.662
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

00:12:31.787 --> 00:12:33.580
it's hero besting heavy.

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:36.208
But what the audience sees

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:41.213
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:42.881
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

00:12:43.006 --> 00:12:46.301
Then next week,
it's Ron Ely.

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:49.763
And next week,
it's Bob Conrad,

00:12:49.888 --> 00:12:52.808
wearing his tight pants,
kicking your ass.

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:55.185
Yeah.

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:57.855
Now, in another couple of years,
playing punching bag

00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:01.066
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:03.193
that's gonna have
a psychological effect

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.739
on how the audience
perceives you.

00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:08.323
Right.

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:10.284
So, Rick,

00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:13.245
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.290
Mannix?
The Man from U.N.C.I.E.?

00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:18.375
The Girl from U.N.C.I.E.?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.711
How about
Batman and Robin?

00:13:20.836 --> 00:13:22.421
Ping. Pow.

00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:24.423
Choom. Zoom.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.801
Down goes you.

00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:31.430
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:39.229
Or do you go to Rome
and star in Westerns

00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:42.232
and win fucking fights?

00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:50.282
Ticket, señor?

00:13:57.956 --> 00:14:00.042
All right,
what's the matter, partner?

00:14:00.167 --> 00:14:02.503
Well...

00:14:02.628 --> 00:14:06.173
it's official, old buddy.
I'm a has-been.

00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:08.884
What are you talking about?
What did that guy tell you?

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.345
He told me the goddamn truth,
is what he told me.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.641
- Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:17.434
- Hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:18.435
Sorry about that.

00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:20.270
Here. Put these on.

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:21.939
Don't cry
in front of the Mexicans.

00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:24.858
- Son of a bitch.
- What's got you so upset, man?

00:14:24.983 --> 00:14:27.277
Well, if coming face-to-face
with the failure

00:14:27.403 --> 00:14:29.446
that is your career
ain't worth crying about,

00:14:29.613 --> 00:14:31.198
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.283
Right. That guy in there
turn you down?

00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:36.370
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:38.205
Then what's the problem?

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.998
I gotta do
Italian goddamn movies!

00:14:40.124 --> 00:14:41.834
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.962
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't
matter whether I cry in public.

00:14:45.087 --> 00:14:47.256
Nobody remembers
who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.258
<i>At the Hall of Justice here.</i>

00:14:49.383 --> 00:14:51.844
<i>The defense will try
to prove the killing of Kennedy</i>

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.721
<i>- was the product of a sick mind.
- Fuck!</i>

00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:56.390
- Thank you. Hey, let's go.
- Take me home, Cliff.

00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:58.183
Come on, take me home.

00:14:58.308 --> 00:15:00.269

00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:02.896

That's swell, man.

Ten years of-of-of
treading water.

00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:20.099
And now a race
to the bottom. Heh.

00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:22.434
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.729
so I can't say I really know
how you feel.

00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:28.232
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:29.817
Come on, now. Shit.

00:16:29.942 --> 00:16:33.320
Rick, I'm your driver, man.
I'm-I'm your gofer.

00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:35.989
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.741
I like doing shit
around the house

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:39.743
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:42.162
when you're gone.

00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:44.081
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman

00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:45.791
for a while now,

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:47.584
and from where I'm standing,

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.795
going to Rome to star
in movies does not sound

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.756
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

00:16:52.923 --> 00:16:57.094
Come on, now. You ever seen
an-an Italian Western, huh?

00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:59.304
They're awful.
It's a fucking farce.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.932
Yeah, how many you seen?
One? Two?

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:05.144
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

00:18:02.368 --> 00:18:03.869
Oh, hell, man,
stay in I.A.

00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:05.579
Give it what fer
next pilot season.

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:07.831
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:11.085
I'm too insecure now
to score come pilot season.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.046
Screen Gems ain't gonna have
nothing good to say about me.

00:18:14.171 --> 00:18:16.090
<i>- You know that.
- Shit. You made Bounty Law.</i>

00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:18.425
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.968
- No matter what I do...
- Ah...

00:18:20.094 --> 00:18:21.887
I'm always gonna be
the horse's ass

00:18:22.012 --> 00:18:23.639
<i>that got Bounty Law canceled</i>

00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:27.518
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

00:18:29.144 --> 00:18:32.022
- Tom. My friend.
- I met him?

00:18:32.147 --> 00:18:33.399
No, you haven't met him.

00:18:33.524 --> 00:18:35.359
You won't meet him
because I don't think

00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:36.402
- you'd like him.
- Why?

00:18:36.527 --> 00:18:38.028
Well...

00:18:40.197 --> 00:18:43.742
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

00:18:57.965 --> 00:18:58.924
Holy shit. Heh.

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:01.468
That was Polanski.

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:03.095
That was Roman Polanski.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.472
He's lived there
for a month now.

00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:07.975
First time I seen him.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.060
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.314
What do I always say?

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.150
Most important thing
in this town is,

00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:18.610
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

00:19:18.736 --> 00:19:21.321
You don't rent.
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

00:19:21.447 --> 00:19:23.532
Hollywood real estate
means you live here.

00:19:23.657 --> 00:19:27.077
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:29.246
You fucking live here.

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.914
Here I am flat
on my ass,

00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:33.083
and who I got living
next door to me?

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.086
<i>The director of Rosemary's
fucking Baby, that's who.</i>

00:19:36.253 --> 00:19:38.505
Polanski, the hottest director
in town right now,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.923
probably the world.

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:42.009
He's my next-door neighbor.

00:19:42.134 --> 00:19:45.095
I mean, shit. I mean,
who knows what could happen?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.765
I could... I could be
one pool party away

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.767
f-from starring
in a new Polanski movie.

00:19:49.933 --> 00:19:51.268
So you're feeling better
now?

00:19:51.393 --> 00:19:53.145
Aw, yeah, yeah.
Sorry about all that.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.938
Give me my glasses back.

00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:57.024
Oh, come get them, fucker.
Come...

00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:59.360
All right, all right,
Audie Murphy, relax.

00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:01.862
- There you go.
- You need me for anything else?

00:20:01.987 --> 00:20:04.823
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot
of lines to learn for tomorrow.

00:20:04.948 --> 00:20:06.158
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

00:20:06.283 --> 00:20:07.785
I'm gonna get my carcass
on home.

00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:09.870
- All right.
- All right, 7:15 a.m.

00:20:09.995 --> 00:20:11.663
- Seven-fifteen.
- Out the door.

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:13.123
- Out the door.
- In the car.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.291
All right,
see you then.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.508
Hello, coming in. Hello.

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:11.510
Hello, darling. Hello.

00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:13.804
Mm. Mm.

00:23:13.971 --> 00:23:15.597
Come here.

00:23:15.723 --> 00:23:17.725
Hello, sweetheart.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.145
Mm. How was your day?
Hmm?

00:23:21.311 --> 00:23:23.063
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:26.483
Wait until you see
what I got for you.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.610
Look what I got for you.

00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:30.195
Gonna blow your mind, man.

00:23:34.366 --> 00:23:36.326
Come here. Come here.

00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:41.498
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

00:24:41.392 --> 00:24:42.893
Was that a whine?

00:24:44.353 --> 00:24:45.896
What did I tell you
about whining?

00:24:46.021 --> 00:24:47.398
You whine, you don't eat.

00:24:47.523 --> 00:24:49.233
I will throw this shit
in the trash.

00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:50.734
I don't wanna, but I will.

00:24:52.194 --> 00:24:53.070
You understand?

00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:55.739
All right.

00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:33.652
<i>I waited at
the bar till closing time,</i>

00:25:33.777 --> 00:25:36.321
<i>but he never came back.</i>

00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:38.741
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

00:25:38.866 --> 00:25:41.493
<i>I don't know.
Everything was fine.</i>

00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:43.287
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

00:25:43.412 --> 00:25:44.830
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

00:25:44.955 --> 00:25:46.790
<i>- while I was doing the dishes,
- Tsk, tsk.</i>

00:25:46.915 --> 00:25:49.209
<i>He and Tobey played.</i>

00:25:49.334 --> 00:25:51.378
<i>And then, at the club,
Gabe was doing great.</i>

00:25:51.503 --> 00:25:53.630
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:57.134
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

00:25:57.301 --> 00:25:59.178
<i>- Who knows what got into him?
- Yeah.</i>

00:26:05.184 --> 00:26:09.563
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal
tape starting in five, four,</i>

00:26:09.688 --> 00:26:12.274
<i>three, two, one.</i>

00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:16.695
Pepe, get your behind
behind that bar! I got a guest.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.280
<i>Johnny says...</i>

00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:21.450
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

00:26:21.575 --> 00:26:22.868
<i>How's the beans?</i>

00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:24.036
I've had worse.

00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:28.207
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

00:26:28.332 --> 00:26:29.833
<i>A toast.</i>

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.336
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:35.047
May they never meet.

00:26:35.172 --> 00:26:37.674
Señor Madrid,
care to join me at my table

00:26:37.841 --> 00:26:40.677
where I entertain my guests?

00:26:40.844 --> 00:26:43.889
<i>I would be
delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:48.268
Take the bottle with you.

00:26:48.394 --> 00:26:50.437
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

00:26:50.562 --> 00:26:52.898
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours

00:26:53.023 --> 00:26:54.400
with the fiddle?

00:26:54.525 --> 00:26:56.360
<i>She's asleep.</i>

00:26:56.527 --> 00:26:58.570
Well, wake her the heck up,
get her down here

00:26:58.696 --> 00:27:01.740
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guests.

00:27:01.865 --> 00:27:04.410
<i>Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

00:27:04.535 --> 00:27:05.536
<i>I beg you.</i>

00:27:05.661 --> 00:27:07.121
I ain't gonna hurt her.

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.039
Just want her
to play the fiddle.

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:10.749
Fetch her and tell her
I'll give her

00:27:10.874 --> 00:27:12.126
a fat $5 gold piece,

00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:15.170
she play her little chili pepper
heart out.

00:27:15.295 --> 00:27:18.215
So, Johnny, what else
you heard about me?

00:27:18.382 --> 00:27:21.135
<i>I heard you're
pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.011
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

00:27:23.137 --> 00:27:27.641
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.</i>

00:27:29.727 --> 00:27:31.145
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.439
I'll open the door for you.

00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:35.190
You look good.

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:49.413
I think Steve's
gonna be there too.

00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:50.497
Oh, yeah.

00:29:04.655 --> 00:29:06.699
Oh, look. They're here.

00:29:21.505 --> 00:29:24.216
Welcome to the Playboy
Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:27.344
Hey, how are you doing,
baby?

00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:30.264
Hey! Heh. How are you?

00:29:43.193 --> 00:29:45.446
Oh, Cass!

00:29:57.207 --> 00:29:58.959
Yeah!

00:30:04.423 --> 00:30:05.758
Yeah, baby!

00:30:08.552 --> 00:30:11.555
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

00:30:20.439 --> 00:30:21.940
Oh, yeah.

00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:57.768
I'm gonna tell you a story.

00:30:57.893 --> 00:31:00.604
She was engaged to him.

00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:09.863
Then she flew
to the UK...

00:31:09.988 --> 00:31:12.157
to make a film
with him,

00:31:12.282 --> 00:31:17.830
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:22.960
Then they moved
to Los Angeles,

00:31:23.127 --> 00:31:25.170
and the three of them

00:31:25.295 --> 00:31:27.131
have been inseparable.

00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:29.508
Really?

00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:32.720
What's up?

00:31:34.388 --> 00:31:37.766
Jay loves Sharon,
that's what's up.

00:31:37.891 --> 00:31:40.936
- Mm.
- And he knows...

00:31:41.061 --> 00:31:44.314
as sure as God made
little green apples...

00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:47.901
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's

00:31:48.027 --> 00:31:49.319
gonna fuck things up,

00:31:49.486 --> 00:31:52.698
and when he does,
Jay's gonna be there.

00:31:52.823 --> 00:31:55.075
Well, one thing's
for sure.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.869
Yeah?

00:31:56.994 --> 00:31:58.203
What's that?

00:31:58.328 --> 00:32:01.832
Sharon absolutely has a type.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.210
Cute, short, talented guys

00:32:05.335 --> 00:32:08.172
who look
like 12-year-old boys.

00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:10.090
Yeah.

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:16.013
I never stood a chance.

00:32:54.218 --> 00:32:56.345
Argh. Fuck you,
Dr. Sapirstein.

00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:42.474
Oh, here we are.

00:33:45.018 --> 00:33:49.398
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

00:33:49.523 --> 00:33:52.026
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

00:33:52.151 --> 00:33:53.027
Go ahead.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.407
You can talk to him.
Just talk to him.

00:33:58.532 --> 00:34:00.534
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:04.329
Ahem. I think the wind blew
down my TV antenna last night,

00:34:04.455 --> 00:34:07.166
so while I piss-fart
around with wardrobe,

00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:08.834
you mind going home
and fixing it?

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.795
I can. You talk to
the stunt gaffer about me today?

00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:14.298
That way I'll know
if I'm working this week or not.

00:34:14.465 --> 00:34:16.633
Yeah. Ahem.
I've been meaning to tell you.

00:34:16.759 --> 00:34:20.846
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:22.514
<i>the gaffer
from The Green Hornet...</i>

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.892
so there ain't no point.

00:34:25.017 --> 00:34:27.394
If you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:29.730
I don't need you. Not today.

00:34:29.855 --> 00:34:33.692
Go home, fix my antenna,
do whatever. See you at wrap.

00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:38.447
Hey!

00:34:38.572 --> 00:34:41.742
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

00:34:51.877 --> 00:34:53.003
Hey, hey.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.463
Hey, buddy,
I'm Rick Dalton.

00:34:54.588 --> 00:34:56.131
You know
where I'm supposed to go?

00:34:56.256 --> 00:34:58.384
They're waiting for you
in the makeup trailer.

00:34:58.509 --> 00:35:00.219
Where's the makeup trailer?

00:35:00.344 --> 00:35:02.429
Straight back the way you came,
hard right.

00:35:07.476 --> 00:35:09.436
Oh, my God.

00:35:15.192 --> 00:35:16.610
Rick Dalton.

00:35:16.735 --> 00:35:18.028
Sam Wanamaker.

00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:19.613
Hey, Sam.

00:35:19.738 --> 00:35:20.864
Sorry about the wet hand.

00:35:21.031 --> 00:35:22.866
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it with Yul.

00:35:23.033 --> 00:35:25.411
I want you to know,
I'm the one who cast you.

00:35:25.536 --> 00:35:28.205
And I couldn't be more
delighted you're doing this.

00:35:28.372 --> 00:35:29.540
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

00:35:29.665 --> 00:35:32.084
I... I appreciate it.
It's a good part.

00:35:32.209 --> 00:35:35.129
Yeah, it is. Have you met
Jim Stacy, the series lead?

00:35:35.254 --> 00:35:36.547
Uh, not yet, no. No.

00:35:36.714 --> 00:35:39.425
Well, you guys are going
to be dynamite together.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.509
Mm. Mm.

00:35:40.634 --> 00:35:42.928
Well, it sounds exciting.

00:35:43.053 --> 00:35:45.097
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.
- Mm.

00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:47.349
Now, you met Sonya,
makeup and hair?

00:35:47.474 --> 00:35:48.642
Hi.

00:35:48.767 --> 00:35:50.728
And this is Rebekka,
who does costumes.

00:35:50.894 --> 00:35:52.271
Hello.

00:35:52.396 --> 00:35:53.731
- Hi.
- Howdy.

00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:55.607
I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

00:35:55.733 --> 00:35:57.276
I don't want this
Western costumed

00:35:57.401 --> 00:35:59.028
<i>the way they costumed
The Big Valley</i>

00:35:59.153 --> 00:36:00.863
<i>and Bonanza
for the last decade.</i>

00:36:00.988 --> 00:36:03.574
I want a zeitgeist flair
to the costumes.

00:36:05.242 --> 00:36:06.660
I mean,
nothing anachronistic,

00:36:06.785 --> 00:36:10.998
but where does 1869
and 1969 meet?

00:36:11.123 --> 00:36:13.667
Especially when it comes
to you, Caleb.

00:36:13.792 --> 00:36:15.127
Mm. Mm.

00:36:15.252 --> 00:36:17.129
First off,
I want to give him a mustache.

00:36:17.254 --> 00:36:21.842
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:23.969
Now, about his jacket.

00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:25.846
I want to give him
a hippie jacket.

00:36:25.971 --> 00:36:28.348
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

00:36:28.474 --> 00:36:30.434
and look like the hippest guy
in the room.

00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.770
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket.

00:36:32.895 --> 00:36:34.438
Fringes all down the arm.

00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:37.358
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

00:36:37.483 --> 00:36:39.443
he could hit the Strip in it
tonight.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.570
That's my girl. Heh.

00:36:41.695 --> 00:36:44.531
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

00:36:44.656 --> 00:36:46.492
I want to go
with a different hairstyle.

00:36:46.617 --> 00:36:47.659
Huh. What?

00:36:47.785 --> 00:36:50.412
Something
more hippie-ish.

00:36:50.537 --> 00:36:53.791
You want me
to look like a hippie?

00:36:53.957 --> 00:36:56.919
Well, think less hippie,
more...

00:36:57.044 --> 00:36:58.087
Hells Angel!

00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:02.633
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.552
Sam. Sam, uh...

00:37:05.677 --> 00:37:07.554
if you got me covered up
in all this...

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:09.973
this junk, uh,

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.892
how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

00:37:12.976 --> 00:37:14.061
I hope they don't.

00:37:14.186 --> 00:37:15.396
Mm.

00:37:15.521 --> 00:37:19.900
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

00:37:20.025 --> 00:37:22.861
I want them to see Caleb.

00:37:22.986 --> 00:37:25.823
I hired you
to be an actor, Rick.

00:37:25.948 --> 00:37:29.076
Not a TV cowboy.
You're better than that.

00:40:40.684 --> 00:40:44.438
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

00:40:44.563 --> 00:40:45.939
<i>he's best friends
with Randy,</i>

00:40:46.065 --> 00:40:47.608
<i>the gaffer
from The Green Hornet,</i>

00:40:47.733 --> 00:40:50.069
<i>so there really
ain't no point.</i>

00:41:05.417 --> 00:41:06.668
Hey, Randy.

00:41:09.046 --> 00:41:10.964
Cliff.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.384
So you're still with Rick,
huh?

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.426
Still here.

00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:16.804
He in there?

00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:18.972
Yeah. Just knock.

00:41:23.352 --> 00:41:26.146
Look, just put him
in the wardrobe, all right?

00:41:26.271 --> 00:41:27.398
What's it gonna hurt?

00:41:27.523 --> 00:41:29.108
Then if you need him,
you got him.

00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:30.901
But then I gotta have
a conversation

00:41:31.026 --> 00:41:32.569
with that
wardrobe assistant,

00:41:32.736 --> 00:41:35.489
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
- I just don't... Please, I...

00:41:35.614 --> 00:41:38.409
Look, Randy, I'm asking you
to help me out, man.

00:41:38.534 --> 00:41:40.244
If the answer's no,
the answer's no,

00:41:40.369 --> 00:41:42.830
not no with excuses.

00:41:42.955 --> 00:41:45.249
Hey, man.

00:41:45.374 --> 00:41:48.419
This ain't a fucking
Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:51.296
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

00:41:51.422 --> 00:41:53.465
and sit around talking
to each other all day

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.217
on the chance
that I might use them.

00:41:55.342 --> 00:41:56.844
I got a four-man team here,
Rick.

00:41:56.969 --> 00:41:59.304
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.890
And, you know,
I gotta look after my dudes.

00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:04.893
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:06.437
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

00:42:06.603 --> 00:42:09.148
but-but that's not the case,
and you know it.

00:42:09.273 --> 00:42:11.358
- He's a great match for me.
- Yeah, no...

00:42:11.483 --> 00:42:13.485
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.697
Throw him off a building, right?
Light him on fire.

00:42:16.822 --> 00:42:18.615
Hit him with
a fucking Lincoln, right?

00:42:18.782 --> 00:42:20.325
Get creative.
Do whatever you want.

00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:22.119
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

00:42:22.286 --> 00:42:24.288
- Rick.
- Yeah?

00:42:26.457 --> 00:42:28.375
I don't dig him.

00:42:30.002 --> 00:42:33.338
And I don't dig the vibe
he brings on a set.

00:42:33.464 --> 00:42:36.133
What, is there some old beef
between the two of you?

00:42:36.258 --> 00:42:38.510
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

00:42:38.635 --> 00:42:40.846
The dude killed
his fucking wife.

00:42:42.806 --> 00:42:46.143
Come on, man. You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

00:42:46.268 --> 00:42:47.853
Yes, Rick, I do.

00:42:47.978 --> 00:42:51.023
And I work with my wife,
and she believes it.

00:42:51.148 --> 00:42:53.317
She doesn't want
his creepy ass around.

00:42:55.652 --> 00:42:57.196
You know, this is probably

00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:59.531
the shittiest weather ever.

00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:02.785
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.411
with the shittiest person.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.708
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:11.794
They all said it,
"He's a fucking loser,"

00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:13.170
and I didn't believe them.

00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:16.256
So I guess
I'm the fucking idiot.

00:43:16.382 --> 00:43:18.008
And now you're not
gonna talk to me?

00:43:18.175 --> 00:43:20.427
What, you don't feel
like fighting?

00:43:20.552 --> 00:43:22.179
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

00:43:22.346 --> 00:43:24.390
because I've been up here
by myself

00:43:24.515 --> 00:43:28.102
for four hours on this
fucking shithole of a boat.

00:43:28.227 --> 00:43:29.853
Yeah.

00:43:31.897 --> 00:43:35.192
H-he's a goddamn
war hero. Fuck.

00:43:37.528 --> 00:43:38.737
Yeah, appreciate it.

00:43:42.866 --> 00:43:48.038
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

00:43:50.708 --> 00:43:52.668
Now, I'll put you
in wardrobe,

00:43:52.793 --> 00:43:55.379
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

00:43:55.546 --> 00:43:58.424
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

00:43:58.549 --> 00:44:01.218
You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

00:44:01.385 --> 00:44:02.720
Yeah.

00:44:02.886 --> 00:44:05.055
Steer clear of her.

00:44:05.222 --> 00:44:08.392
Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.769
What I admire is,
in his sport,

00:44:10.894 --> 00:44:13.147
there's an element
of true combat.

00:44:13.272 --> 00:44:15.816
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

00:44:15.941 --> 00:44:18.152
that's not two athletes
posturing.

00:44:18.277 --> 00:44:20.154
That's combat.

00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:23.449
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

00:44:23.574 --> 00:44:25.617
If you don't beat him...

00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:27.828
he kills you.

00:44:27.953 --> 00:44:29.580
That's beyond athletics.

00:44:29.705 --> 00:44:33.250
<i>That's beyond
Wide World of Sports, you know?</i>

00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:35.252
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:37.838
That's what I admire.

00:44:37.963 --> 00:44:39.298
In martial arts tournaments,

00:44:39.423 --> 00:44:41.008
they won't let you fight
like that.

00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:43.135
It's very frustrating.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.595
You stand in front of a guy,

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.514
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:49.183
But you can't.

00:44:49.308 --> 00:44:53.270
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

00:44:53.395 --> 00:44:56.482
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

00:44:56.607 --> 00:44:57.691
The colored boxer,

00:44:57.816 --> 00:44:59.485
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

00:45:00.819 --> 00:45:03.530
They do what
they need to do to win.

00:45:03.655 --> 00:45:05.574
They unleash
as much punishment

00:45:05.699 --> 00:45:08.035
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

00:45:09.203 --> 00:45:10.829
But in martial arts
tournaments,

00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:13.332
I do to win what
they do to win.

00:45:13.457 --> 00:45:16.377
I unleash all my power.

00:45:17.127 --> 00:45:18.796
I kill people.

00:45:18.962 --> 00:45:21.048
If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

00:45:21.173 --> 00:45:23.842
Well,
that would never happen.

00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:26.470
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

00:45:27.679 --> 00:45:29.014
I'd make him a cripple.

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:35.145
Hey, you. What's your name?

00:45:35.312 --> 00:45:37.690
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

00:45:38.982 --> 00:45:40.526
My name's Cliff.

00:45:40.651 --> 00:45:42.653
I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.406
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

00:45:45.531 --> 00:45:48.033
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

00:45:48.158 --> 00:45:49.910
That's what they tell me.

00:45:50.035 --> 00:45:53.914
So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

00:45:54.039 --> 00:45:57.084
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

00:45:57.209 --> 00:45:59.211
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:00.754
I'm just here
to do a job.

00:46:00.879 --> 00:46:02.673
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.341
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

00:46:04.508 --> 00:46:06.802
So, what do you think
is so funny?

00:46:08.095 --> 00:46:10.222
What I think is...

00:46:12.433 --> 00:46:14.977
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

00:46:15.102 --> 00:46:16.812
and I think you
should be embarrassed

00:46:16.937 --> 00:46:19.064
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

00:46:19.189 --> 00:46:21.984
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:24.945
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.739
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

00:46:26.864 --> 00:46:29.867
especially in front
of all my friends.

00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:33.370
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

00:46:33.495 --> 00:46:35.748
That means,
we get into a fight,

00:46:35.873 --> 00:46:39.793
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

00:46:39.918 --> 00:46:41.545
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.921
in a fight,
they go to jail.

00:46:43.047 --> 00:46:44.465
It's called
manslaughter.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.717
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

00:46:46.884 --> 00:46:48.385
is just an excuse
so you dancers

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.637
never have to get
in a real fight.

00:46:51.889 --> 00:46:52.765
Okay.

00:46:54.016 --> 00:46:55.809
How about
a friendly contest?

00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:58.937
No punching in the face.

00:46:59.063 --> 00:47:00.606
Two out of three.

00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:02.733
Who puts who
on the ground first?

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.738
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

00:47:11.575 --> 00:47:14.036
That's a great idea, Kato.

00:47:25.672 --> 00:47:27.674
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kind of famous.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.301
That guy?

00:47:29.426 --> 00:47:30.803
For what?

00:47:30.928 --> 00:47:33.305
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.598
That guy?

00:47:34.723 --> 00:47:36.266
That guy.

00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:02.167
Not bad, Kato.

00:48:03.502 --> 00:48:05.295
Try that again.

00:48:46.378 --> 00:48:48.714
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:48:48.839 --> 00:48:50.591
What the fuck
is going on here?

00:48:50.716 --> 00:48:53.844
Hey, jackass,
this is our series lead.

00:48:53.969 --> 00:48:55.512
What the fuck
are you thinking?

00:48:55.679 --> 00:48:57.848
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

00:48:58.015 --> 00:49:00.559
Don't fucking "Janet" me,
you prick.

00:49:00.684 --> 00:49:02.895
Hey.
What's up, babe?

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.357
What's up, Randy,
is that your loser asshole,

00:49:06.523 --> 00:49:09.693
wife-killing buddy boy here was
beating the shit out of Bruce.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.236
What?

00:49:11.362 --> 00:49:13.364
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.240
What the fuck, man?

00:49:15.366 --> 00:49:18.827
Let me just say, nobody beat
the shit out of Bruce.

00:49:18.952 --> 00:49:21.205
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

00:49:21.372 --> 00:49:23.916
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

00:49:25.584 --> 00:49:27.795
Oh, my God!

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.339
What the fuck
did you do to my car?!

00:49:30.464 --> 00:49:32.591
What the fuck
did you do to her car?

00:49:32.716 --> 00:49:34.718
I threw this
little prick into it,

00:49:34.843 --> 00:49:36.762
but I did not know
it was her car.

00:49:36.887 --> 00:49:41.392
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

00:49:41.517 --> 00:49:42.434
- Janet!
- What?

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:43.644
I will handle this.

00:49:43.769 --> 00:49:45.396
Then fucking handle it,
Randy.

00:49:46.897 --> 00:49:47.773
Cliff...

00:49:49.066 --> 00:49:52.152
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit,

00:49:52.277 --> 00:49:53.987
and get off the lot.

00:49:57.032 --> 00:49:58.409
Fair enough.

00:50:32.693 --> 00:50:35.112
Aw. What's the matter?

00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:39.116
Are you afraid I'll tell
Jim Morrison you were dancing

00:50:39.241 --> 00:50:41.535
to Paul Revere
and the Raiders?

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.537
Are they not
cool enough for you?

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.632
Who's this
shaggy asshole?

00:50:57.342 --> 00:50:58.677
Hello? Can I help you?

00:50:58.802 --> 00:51:01.513
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.
I'm looking for Terry.

00:51:01.638 --> 00:51:04.683
I'm a friend of Terry's
and Dennis Wilson's.

00:51:04.808 --> 00:51:06.977
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

00:51:07.102 --> 00:51:08.687
This is the Polanski
residence now.

00:51:08.812 --> 00:51:11.148
Really? He moved?

00:51:11.815 --> 00:51:12.691
Dang.

00:51:14.026 --> 00:51:15.861
Uh, you know...?
You know where?

00:51:15.986 --> 00:51:18.280
I'm not sure,
but the owner of the property,

00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:21.283
Paul, might.
He's in the guest house.

00:51:21.408 --> 00:51:22.868
Who is it, Jay?

00:51:22.993 --> 00:51:26.455
It's okay, honey.
It's a friend of Terry's.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.665
Yeah, just take
the back path.

00:51:28.832 --> 00:51:29.958
Thank you kindly.

00:51:32.086 --> 00:51:33.420
Ma'am.

00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:51.563
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

00:51:51.689 --> 00:51:53.273
I know they just
broke for lunch,

00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:56.110
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

00:51:56.235 --> 00:51:58.904
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

00:51:59.029 --> 00:52:03.367
I got my book. Say, say,
where's the bad-guy saloon?

00:52:03.492 --> 00:52:05.577
You just go straight
through the Western town,

00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:08.205
take a right and a left,
and you see it right there.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.916
Thanks, honey.

00:52:12.292 --> 00:52:14.294
Can we move to number two?

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.879
How is his bounce?

00:52:16.046 --> 00:52:17.631
Can I get a bounce there?

00:52:17.756 --> 00:52:20.259
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

00:52:20.384 --> 00:52:21.593
Just make it a quick one.

00:52:22.928 --> 00:52:25.472
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

00:53:11.143 --> 00:53:12.478
Hello.

00:53:14.813 --> 00:53:15.731
Hello.

00:53:18.484 --> 00:53:19.818
Hello.

00:53:21.987 --> 00:53:23.197
Would...

00:53:23.322 --> 00:53:25.032
Would it bother you
if I sat

00:53:25.157 --> 00:53:27.159
next to you
and read my book too?

00:53:29.495 --> 00:53:31.038
I don't know.

00:53:31.955 --> 00:53:34.041
Would you bother me?

00:53:34.166 --> 00:53:35.626
I'll try not to.

00:53:39.046 --> 00:53:40.172
Sit.

00:54:25.175 --> 00:54:26.176
Ah.

00:54:27.428 --> 00:54:31.265
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Ahem.

00:54:36.603 --> 00:54:37.855
You don't eat lunch?

00:54:39.231 --> 00:54:41.400
I've got a scene
after lunch.

00:54:41.525 --> 00:54:42.526
Yeah?

00:54:44.194 --> 00:54:47.448
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

00:54:47.573 --> 00:54:49.366
I believe it's the job
of an actor...

00:54:49.533 --> 00:54:51.618
And I say "actor,"
not "actress,"

00:54:51.744 --> 00:54:54.538
because the word "actress"
is nonsensical.

00:54:54.705 --> 00:54:56.915
It's the actor's job
to avoid

00:54:57.041 --> 00:54:59.084
impediments
to their performance.

00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:03.797
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

00:55:03.922 --> 00:55:08.052
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

00:55:08.844 --> 00:55:10.262
that's meaningful.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.391
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

00:55:14.516 --> 00:55:17.394
Mar... Marabella what?

00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:19.021
Marabella Lancer.

00:55:19.146 --> 00:55:22.399
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

00:55:24.568 --> 00:55:26.528
When we're on set,
I'd prefer to only

00:55:26.653 --> 00:55:28.572
be referred to
by my character's name.

00:55:28.739 --> 00:55:31.825
It helps me invest
in the reality of the story.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.119
I've tried it both ways,
and I'm always just

00:55:34.244 --> 00:55:36.455
a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:40.125
And if I can be
a tiny bit better, I want to be.

00:55:43.337 --> 00:55:46.298
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

00:55:49.968 --> 00:55:53.263
I thought it was
pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.517
I'm pretty sure
it's "DeCoteau."

00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:00.604
- DeCoteau.
- Mm.

00:56:02.106 --> 00:56:04.942
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:07.486
Hmm.

00:56:22.835 --> 00:56:24.169
What are you reading?

00:56:25.504 --> 00:56:27.965
It's a biography
on Walt Disney.

00:56:28.132 --> 00:56:29.675
It's fascinating.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.635
He's a genius, you know.

00:56:31.802 --> 00:56:35.139
I mean, a once-in-every-50
- or-100-years kind of genius.

00:56:35.305 --> 00:56:37.349
What are you, 12?

00:56:38.225 --> 00:56:39.393
I'm 8.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.062
What are you reading?

00:56:43.647 --> 00:56:44.857
Just a Western.

00:56:44.982 --> 00:56:47.943
What does that mean?
Is it good?

00:56:48.068 --> 00:56:51.030
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

00:56:52.489 --> 00:56:54.158
I haven't finished
it yet.

00:56:54.324 --> 00:56:57.411
I didn't ask
for the whole story.

00:56:57.536 --> 00:56:59.246
What's the idea
of the story?

00:57:00.664 --> 00:57:02.166
Well... ahem,

00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:05.335
it's about this guy
who's a bronco buster.

00:57:06.545 --> 00:57:08.505
It's the story
of his life.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.675
Guy's name
is Tom Breezy,

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.845
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.514
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s

00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:20.684
and-and-and young and
good-looking, he could...

00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:24.021
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

00:57:24.188 --> 00:57:27.066
Back then,
he just had a way.

00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:30.486
Now he's into
his, uh, late 30s

00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:33.197
and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

00:57:33.364 --> 00:57:35.741
He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

00:57:35.866 --> 00:57:38.202
or anything like that, but...

00:57:38.369 --> 00:57:40.329
But he's got
spine problems

00:57:40.454 --> 00:57:43.123
he never had before,
and he spends, uh...

00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:48.295
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:51.340
Jeepers, this sounds
like a good novel.

00:57:52.257 --> 00:57:54.093
Yeah, it's not bad.

00:57:55.094 --> 00:57:56.804
Where are you in it?

00:57:56.929 --> 00:57:59.139
Mm. About midway.

00:58:00.516 --> 00:58:03.727
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

00:58:03.852 --> 00:58:06.313
Uh, he's, um...
He...

00:58:07.731 --> 00:58:09.483
He's not the best
anymore.

00:58:10.734 --> 00:58:12.611
In fact,
far from it. And...

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:18.450
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

00:58:21.245 --> 00:58:22.788
use...

00:58:30.587 --> 00:58:34.842
Slightly more useless
each day.

00:58:50.315 --> 00:58:52.192
I-it's okay, Caleb.

00:58:52.317 --> 00:58:53.861
It's okay.

00:58:53.986 --> 00:58:56.447
It sounds like
a really sad book.

00:58:56.572 --> 00:58:58.449
Poor Easy Breezy.

00:58:58.615 --> 00:59:01.035
I'm practically crying,
and I haven't even read it.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.997
About 15 years,
you'll be living it.

00:59:05.122 --> 00:59:06.457
What?

00:59:09.793 --> 00:59:12.546
Nothing, pumpkin puss.
I'm just...

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.049
I'm just teasing you.

00:59:16.425 --> 00:59:18.218
You know something? You...

00:59:19.636 --> 00:59:22.389
You might be right
about this book.

00:59:22.514 --> 00:59:25.726
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:30.856
I don't like names
like "pumpkin puss,"

00:59:31.857 --> 00:59:33.817
but since you're upset,

00:59:33.984 --> 00:59:35.903
we'll talk about that
some other time.

01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:32.918
I'm only going as far
as Westwood Village.

01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:34.712
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

01:00:34.878 --> 01:00:35.754
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.027
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

01:00:59.403 --> 01:01:01.238
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

01:01:01.363 --> 01:01:03.741
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

01:01:03.866 --> 01:01:05.075
- Take care.
- You too.

01:02:11.475 --> 01:02:13.977
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:16.689
How can I help you,
young lady?

01:02:16.814 --> 01:02:19.066
Oh.

01:02:19.191 --> 01:02:20.901
I'm here to pick up
a first edition

01:02:21.026 --> 01:02:23.570
<i>of Thomas Hardy's Tess
of the d'Urbervilles I ordered.</i>

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:24.863
It's under Polanski.

01:02:24.988 --> 01:02:26.740
Yeah, you're talking books
there, kid.

01:02:26.865 --> 01:02:28.242
Oh, I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:02:28.367 --> 01:02:30.244
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- I just read it.

01:02:30.369 --> 01:02:32.705
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.
- Mm.

01:02:35.499 --> 01:02:38.001
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:40.671
Jim Stacy. This is my show.
Welcome aboard.

01:02:40.838 --> 01:02:42.548
We're real glad
to have a pro like you

01:02:42.673 --> 01:02:44.091
playing the heavy
on the pilot.

01:02:44.216 --> 01:02:46.593
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.388
<i>to being in The Fourteen
Fists of McCluskey.</i>

01:02:49.513 --> 01:02:50.681
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.848 --> 01:02:52.391
Let me tell you, I...

01:02:52.516 --> 01:02:54.727
I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

01:02:54.852 --> 01:02:56.520
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

01:02:56.687 --> 01:02:58.313
Fabian was in the part.

01:02:58.439 --> 01:03:01.025
<i>Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a Virginian.</i>

01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:02.359
That's how I got it, so...

01:03:02.526 --> 01:03:03.402
Ah.

01:03:05.154 --> 01:03:08.741
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

01:03:08.866 --> 01:03:10.075
Was it true
you almost got

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.910
<i>the McQueen part
in The Great Escape?</i>

01:03:13.579 --> 01:03:16.582
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

01:03:16.707 --> 01:03:18.542
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

01:03:18.667 --> 01:03:21.253
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

01:03:21.378 --> 01:03:22.713
Never met John Sturges.

01:03:22.838 --> 01:03:25.382
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

01:03:25.507 --> 01:03:27.468
I almost got the part, but...

01:03:27.593 --> 01:03:29.887
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

01:03:30.054 --> 01:03:32.306
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:34.308
a hotshot pilot.

01:03:34.433 --> 01:03:38.520
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

01:03:38.645 --> 01:03:41.440
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:43.067
and during that
brief moment,

01:03:43.233 --> 01:03:45.402
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:46.653
You have other plans?

01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:47.988
I haven't seen Berlin yet

01:03:48.113 --> 01:03:49.573
from the ground
or from the air,

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.909
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

01:03:52.076 --> 01:03:53.452
You and who?

01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:56.747
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

01:03:56.914 --> 01:03:58.374
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

01:03:58.499 --> 01:04:00.000
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.377
That's gotta hurt.

01:04:01.502 --> 01:04:03.545
Yeah, well,
I didn't get it,

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:04.963
McQueen did it,

01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:07.466
and, frankly,
I never had a chance.

01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:11.762
Ten days isolation,
Hilts.

01:04:11.887 --> 01:04:12.930
Captain Hilts.

01:04:13.097 --> 01:04:14.848
Twenty days.

01:04:14.973 --> 01:04:15.933
Right.

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:20.104
Oh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

01:04:21.438 --> 01:04:23.107
Cooler.

01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:20.998
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:26.336
What if I'm in the movie?

01:05:26.503 --> 01:05:28.047
What do you mean?

01:05:28.172 --> 01:05:30.758
I mean, I'm in the movie.

01:05:30.883 --> 01:05:32.343
I'm Sharon Tate.

01:05:32.509 --> 01:05:34.928
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:35.054 --> 01:05:37.181
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.683
That's me.

01:05:41.435 --> 01:05:44.104
<i>But that's the girl
from Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:05:45.731 --> 01:05:49.777
<i>Well, that's me, the girl
from Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:51.528
Really?

01:05:51.695 --> 01:05:52.946
Really.

01:05:55.366 --> 01:05:57.785
Hey, Rubin!
Come out here.

01:06:00.913 --> 01:06:03.749
<i>This is the girl
from Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:06:03.874 --> 01:06:05.918
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:08.212
<i>- The girl from Peyton Place?
- No, the other one.</i>

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:10.673
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

01:06:10.798 --> 01:06:13.717
- Oh.
- She's in this movie.

01:06:13.842 --> 01:06:15.386
- Oh.
- Sharon Tate.

01:06:15.552 --> 01:06:18.889
Well, welcome
to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

01:06:19.056 --> 01:06:20.641
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

01:06:20.766 --> 01:06:22.768
Would you like to come in
and see the show?

01:06:22.893 --> 01:06:23.769
Could I?

01:06:23.894 --> 01:06:25.104
By all means.

01:06:26.105 --> 01:06:27.064
Thank you.

01:06:29.024 --> 01:06:30.901
Hey, can I get
a picture?

01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:31.944
Oh, sure.

01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.986
Okay.

01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:39.576
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster

01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:41.662
so people will know
who you are.

01:06:41.787 --> 01:06:44.039
Okay. Could you?

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.220
Would you like
some refreshments?

01:06:58.345 --> 01:07:00.973
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

01:07:37.176 --> 01:07:39.511
<i>Can I ask
you a personal question?</i>

01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:41.889
<i>- I wish you would.
- How did a nice boy</i>

01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:44.850
<i>like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

01:07:44.975 --> 01:07:46.852
<i>I turned to them
after I was rejected</i>

01:07:46.977 --> 01:07:49.063
<i>by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</i>

01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:13.295
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:16.048
<i>- Mr. Helm?
- Yes?</i>

01:08:16.173 --> 01:08:17.257
<i>Oh!</i>

01:08:21.178 --> 01:08:22.596
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

01:08:22.721 --> 01:08:25.057
<i>Welcome to Denmark,
Mr. Helm.</i>

01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:28.894
<i>These are for you. Street maps,
places of interest.</i>

01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:30.354
<i>This is for you too.</i>

01:08:32.147 --> 01:08:33.857
<i>- What year was that?
- 1949.</i>

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:35.693
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

01:08:35.818 --> 01:08:37.528
<i>I'm here to
help any way I can.</i>

01:08:37.653 --> 01:08:38.529
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:39.530
<i>Is there anything</i>

01:08:39.655 --> 01:08:40.906
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:43.033
<i>- Yes, a couple things.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:46.453
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

01:08:46.578 --> 01:08:48.205
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.</i>

01:08:48.372 --> 01:08:50.374
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:51.500
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.545
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

01:09:03.137 --> 01:09:06.140
<i>This is some kind of hotel
you've got here.</i>

01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:10.519
<i>Half a bottle
is better than none.</i>

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.989
Morning, partner.

01:09:22.114 --> 01:09:24.491
Probably come
by to see you later.

01:09:58.275 --> 01:10:00.361
That's far enough,
jughead.

01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:02.696
Name's not jughead.

01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:06.241
What you doing
around here, boy?

01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:09.286
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,
ain't it?

01:10:09.453 --> 01:10:12.498
Oh, yeah,
that's a saloon.

01:10:12.623 --> 01:10:15.167
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

01:10:17.127 --> 01:10:20.506
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

01:10:22.675 --> 01:10:24.718
I know how bored
and restless you get

01:10:24.843 --> 01:10:26.804
when you run out of tamales.

01:10:28.639 --> 01:10:30.808
But, Mr. Gilbert,
if I was you,

01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:34.812
I'd find out that
jughead's name.

01:10:36.271 --> 01:10:38.899
Allow me to introduce
the two of you.

01:10:40.651 --> 01:10:42.528
This here is Bob Gilbert.

01:10:43.696 --> 01:10:45.406
The Businessman?

01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:47.324
That's right.

01:10:47.449 --> 01:10:51.787
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

01:10:51.912 --> 01:10:55.124
Well,
that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

01:10:55.999 --> 01:10:57.376
Johnny Madrid.

01:10:58.377 --> 01:11:00.295
Who's Johnny Madrid?

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.178
He ain't from round here.

01:11:08.345 --> 01:11:10.347
No, really.

01:11:10.514 --> 01:11:11.557
Who is he, Caleb?

01:11:16.353 --> 01:11:18.105
Oh, you're about
to find out...

01:11:19.898 --> 01:11:20.941
Businessman.

01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:41.628
Ready when you are,
Gilbert.

01:12:23.754 --> 01:12:25.839
Johnny Madrid.

01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:32.513
How long has it been?

01:12:32.638 --> 01:12:36.100
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

01:12:36.266 --> 01:12:39.603
Well, come on in
and have a drink.

01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:42.106
Hell, in that case...

01:12:44.233 --> 01:12:46.485
buy you a drink, Caleb?

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:47.695
Sure, Johnny.

01:12:49.113 --> 01:12:51.699
How about some mezcal?

01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:53.659
Like that time in Juárez.

01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:57.705
A lot of people
died that day.

01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:59.289
Yes, they did.

01:13:00.624 --> 01:13:03.252
But we had a good time.

01:13:03.377 --> 01:13:04.461
Didn't we?

01:13:04.628 --> 01:13:06.588
Yeah, we did.

01:13:07.715 --> 01:13:09.299
After you, DeCoteau.

01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:13.762
Pepe! Get your behind
behind that bar.

01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:15.597
I have a guest.

01:13:31.697 --> 01:13:33.032
How's the beans?

01:13:34.658 --> 01:13:35.993
I've had worse.

01:13:38.287 --> 01:13:40.330
One dollar.

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:47.338
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

01:13:47.463 --> 01:13:49.506
May they never meet.

01:13:56.013 --> 01:13:59.558
Señor Madrid, you care
to join me at my table

01:13:59.683 --> 01:14:01.143
where I entertain
my guests?

01:14:01.268 --> 01:14:03.812
I'd be
delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

01:14:05.522 --> 01:14:07.483
Take the bottle
with you.

01:14:09.193 --> 01:14:11.111
So, Johnny, ahem...

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:14.740
what brings you
to Arroyo del Oro?

01:14:14.865 --> 01:14:17.785
Oh, you know me,
Caleb.

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.411
Money.

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:22.831
And who's paying
around here?

01:14:22.956 --> 01:14:24.416
I hope you.

01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.335
Huh.

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.837
And what have you
heard about me?

01:14:28.962 --> 01:14:30.798
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch.

01:14:30.923 --> 01:14:33.092
All the cattle
you've appropriated.

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:34.593
A lot of land,
a lot of cows,

01:14:34.718 --> 01:14:36.553
a lot of money,
no law to speak of,

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.097
and nothing
but an old man

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:41.141
and some Mexican ranch hands
to shoo you off.

01:14:43.394 --> 01:14:45.562
Say, where's that
chili pepper

01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:47.981
daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

01:14:48.107 --> 01:14:49.900
She's asleep.

01:14:50.025 --> 01:14:52.069
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

01:14:52.236 --> 01:14:55.739
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guest.

01:14:58.575 --> 01:15:00.744
But, please, don't hurt her
this time.

01:15:02.413 --> 01:15:03.872
I ain't gonna hurt her.

01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:07.710
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:14.008
Line? "Go... Go fetch her
and tell her" what?

01:15:14.133 --> 01:15:15.634
"Go fetch her and tell her

01:15:15.759 --> 01:15:17.636
I'll give her a fat
$5 gold piece..."

01:15:17.761 --> 01:15:19.221
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her

01:15:19.346 --> 01:15:21.181
I'll give her
a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

01:15:21.306 --> 01:15:23.642
she play her little
chili pepper heart out, right?

01:15:23.767 --> 01:15:25.102
- Right.
- Got it.

01:15:31.316 --> 01:15:33.152
I ain't gonna hurt her.

01:15:33.277 --> 01:15:35.529
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

01:15:35.654 --> 01:15:36.989
Now, go fetch her
and tell her

01:15:37.114 --> 01:15:38.657
I'll give her
a fat $5 gold piece,

01:15:38.782 --> 01:15:41.827
she play her little
chili pepper heart out.

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:43.662
Go on.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.668
So, Johnny,

01:15:50.961 --> 01:15:52.546
what else you heard?

01:15:52.671 --> 01:15:54.131
Hmm.

01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:56.800
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

01:15:56.967 --> 01:15:59.636
but Lancer's got money.

01:16:00.804 --> 01:16:02.848
At some point,

01:16:02.973 --> 01:16:05.267
he's gonna hire some guns

01:16:05.392 --> 01:16:07.436
and push back.

01:16:14.485 --> 01:16:17.488
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

01:16:20.491 --> 01:16:21.825
Maybe... Goddamn it!

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:23.494
I fucked this
whole thing up, Sam.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.828
Keep going!

01:16:24.995 --> 01:16:26.246
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:28.457
Can we just go back?
Please, can we just cut?

01:16:28.582 --> 01:16:29.917
Just say the fucking line!

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:31.502
No, really, Sam, please.

01:16:31.627 --> 01:16:33.087
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right!

01:16:33.212 --> 01:16:35.589
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

01:16:35.714 --> 01:16:36.674
All right, all right!

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.092
Woo!

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.260
You're a goddamn outlaw,
Rick. Come on, now.

01:16:40.386 --> 01:16:41.887
Woo!

01:16:42.012 --> 01:16:43.764
I got it. I got it.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.517
Go back a bit, would you?

01:16:46.642 --> 01:16:48.894
No, he's right. Back to one.

01:16:49.019 --> 01:16:51.397
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

01:16:51.522 --> 01:16:53.857
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

01:16:54.024 --> 01:16:54.942
I'm gonna use it.

01:16:57.027 --> 01:16:57.945
And...

01:16:59.029 --> 01:17:00.406
action.

01:17:03.325 --> 01:17:05.619
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

01:17:05.744 --> 01:17:08.247
but Lancer's got money.

01:17:09.415 --> 01:17:11.333
At some point,

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:15.713
he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.

01:17:19.216 --> 01:17:21.969
Maybe he already has.

01:17:22.094 --> 01:17:24.596
Maybe.

01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:28.976
Maybe
I don't like Lancer.

01:17:30.477 --> 01:17:32.271
Maybe I don't like
his boots.

01:17:33.939 --> 01:17:35.607
Maybe I don't like the way

01:17:35.733 --> 01:17:38.819
he uses those boots
to step on people.

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:44.033
What the fuck was that?!

01:17:44.158 --> 01:17:46.577
Jesus Christ!

01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:47.911
Fuck!

01:17:48.078 --> 01:17:50.247
Piece of shit.

01:17:50.414 --> 01:17:52.374
Fucking damn it, Rick,
I swear to God.

01:17:52.499 --> 01:17:54.710
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself

01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:57.046
like that in front of all
those goddamn people!

01:17:57.171 --> 01:18:00.132
You were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

01:18:00.257 --> 01:18:03.135
eight goddamn fucking
whiskey sours.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.347
Fucking bullshit.

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.642
You're a fucking
miserable drunk.

01:18:10.768 --> 01:18:13.103
Not fucking remembering
your fucking lines.

01:18:13.228 --> 01:18:15.147
I practiced them,
and now I don't look

01:18:15.272 --> 01:18:16.940
like I goddamn practiced them!

01:18:17.066 --> 01:18:19.193
You're sitting there
like a fucking baboon!

01:18:21.278 --> 01:18:22.988
Fuck! Eight fucking
whiskey sours.

01:18:23.113 --> 01:18:26.116
I couldn't stop at fucking
three or four. I have eight!

01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:27.951
Why?! You're
a fucking alcoholic.

01:18:28.118 --> 01:18:29.787
You fucking drink
too much, huh?

01:18:29.953 --> 01:18:32.289
Every fucking night.
Every fucking night.

01:18:32.456 --> 01:18:34.041
That's it,
that's fucking it!

01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:35.459
That's fucking it.

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:37.795
You stop drinking right now,
all right?

01:18:37.961 --> 01:18:39.213
Make a promise to yourself.

01:18:39.338 --> 01:18:41.465
You're gonna stop
fucking drinking.

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:42.633
Oh, fuck it.

01:18:46.303 --> 01:18:48.138
Damn it!

01:18:48.263 --> 01:18:49.973
You show that
little fucking girl.

01:18:50.099 --> 01:18:52.017
You're gonna show
that goddamn Jim Stacy.

01:18:52.142 --> 01:18:54.561
You're gonna show them
on that goddamn fucking set

01:18:54.687 --> 01:18:56.480
who the fuck
Rick Dalton is, all right?

01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:58.732
Let me tell you something.

01:18:58.857 --> 01:19:01.485
You don't get
these lines right,

01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:04.488
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out tonight.

01:19:04.655 --> 01:19:06.490
All right?
Your brains are gonna

01:19:06.657 --> 01:19:08.992
be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

01:19:09.118 --> 01:19:11.036
I mean it, motherfucker.

01:19:11.161 --> 01:19:12.454
Get your shit together.

01:20:18.687 --> 01:20:20.397
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.401
Hey!

01:21:48.485 --> 01:21:49.361
Hi.

01:21:53.157 --> 01:21:54.575
Huh.

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.702
Woo!

01:21:56.827 --> 01:21:58.037
Shit.

01:22:04.835 --> 01:22:07.212
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

01:22:07.338 --> 01:22:09.173
Oh, no.

01:22:24.563 --> 01:22:25.731
Hello, hot stuff.

01:22:25.856 --> 01:22:28.192
Looks like third time's
the charm.

01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:30.194
Mm. How were those pickles?

01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:35.366
Real good.

01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:36.784
They were
the fancy kind.

01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:38.410
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:22:39.828 --> 01:22:41.038
Give me a lift?

01:22:41.205 --> 01:22:42.414
Where are you going?

01:22:43.874 --> 01:22:46.043
I'm going to Chatsworth.

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.128
Chatsworth?

01:22:48.253 --> 01:22:50.964
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:53.634
till someone says they'll
drive you to Chatsworth?

01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:55.386
Tourists love to drive me.

01:22:55.552 --> 01:22:57.721
I'm their favorite part
of their I.A. vacation.

01:22:57.888 --> 01:23:01.308
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

01:23:01.433 --> 01:23:03.394
that they gave a ride
to the movie ranch

01:23:03.519 --> 01:23:05.104
for the rest of their lives.

01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:06.647
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:08.023 --> 01:23:09.483
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going?

01:23:09.608 --> 01:23:10.567
Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:11.735
Uh-huh.

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.070
Why you going there?

01:23:13.862 --> 01:23:14.738
I live there.

01:23:15.614 --> 01:23:18.117
- Alone?
- No.

01:23:18.242 --> 01:23:19.576
Me and my friends.

01:23:20.994 --> 01:23:23.288
So you and a bunch
of friends like you

01:23:23.414 --> 01:23:25.249
all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:27.626
Yeah.

01:23:29.962 --> 01:23:31.547
Well, hop in.
I'll take you there.

01:23:32.464 --> 01:23:33.674
Great!

01:23:43.142 --> 01:23:45.310
Go down here and get on
the Hollywood Freeway.

01:23:45.436 --> 01:23:46.895
I know where it is.

01:23:48.939 --> 01:23:52.192
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

01:23:52.317 --> 01:23:53.819
Whoa!

01:23:53.944 --> 01:23:55.446
What?

01:23:55.612 --> 01:23:56.947
I'm just surprised
how accurate

01:23:57.114 --> 01:23:58.824
that description
of me really is.

01:23:58.949 --> 01:24:02.286
Some old cowboy guy that used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

01:24:02.453 --> 01:24:05.914
So you used to make Westerns
at the ranch

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.417
back in the old-timey days?

01:24:10.169 --> 01:24:12.755
Well, if by
"the old-timey days,"

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.175
you mean television
eight years ago, yeah.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.634
Are you an actor?

01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:19.386
No, I'm a stuntman.

01:24:20.637 --> 01:24:22.306
You're a stuntman.

01:24:23.474 --> 01:24:25.642
That's way better.

01:24:25.768 --> 01:24:27.061
Why is that way better?

01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:30.481
- Actors are phony.
- Oh.

01:24:30.647 --> 01:24:32.691
They just say lines
that other people write

01:24:32.816 --> 01:24:36.487
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

01:24:36.653 --> 01:24:39.698
Meanwhile, real people are being
murdered every day in Vietnam.

01:25:02.388 --> 01:25:04.264
Want me to suck your cock
while driving?

01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:14.191
How old are you?

01:25:15.484 --> 01:25:16.443
What?

01:25:16.568 --> 01:25:18.237
How old are you?

01:25:20.572 --> 01:25:21.532
Wow, man.

01:25:23.033 --> 01:25:24.827
That's the first time
anybody asked that

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:26.203
in a long time.

01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:27.830
What's the answer?

01:25:30.374 --> 01:25:33.794
Okay. We gonna play
kiddie games?

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:37.673
Eighteen. Feel better?

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:39.591
You got some ID,
you know,

01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:41.885
like a driver's license
or something?

01:25:42.052 --> 01:25:44.680
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:48.267
I need to see something official
that verifies that you're 18,

01:25:48.392 --> 01:25:51.186
which you don't have
because you're not.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.942
Talk about a bring-down bummer,
dude.

01:25:57.067 --> 01:25:58.152
That's you.

01:25:58.277 --> 01:25:59.486
Yeah.

01:26:04.074 --> 01:26:07.953
Obviously,
I'm not too young to fuck you.

01:26:08.078 --> 01:26:10.247
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:15.169
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:19.131
Prison's been trying to get me
all my life.

01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:21.633
It ain't got me yet.
The day it does,

01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:24.178
it won't be because of you.

01:26:24.303 --> 01:26:25.429
No offense.

01:26:28.432 --> 01:26:30.267
<i>You all right?</i>

01:26:30.392 --> 01:26:32.770
She's just
fine, ain't you, shorty?

01:26:32.895 --> 01:26:34.605
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:36.190
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

01:26:36.315 --> 01:26:38.108
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

01:26:39.818 --> 01:26:41.111
I'll be right out.

01:26:42.488 --> 01:26:44.698
<i>The war.</i>

01:26:44.823 --> 01:26:47.659
<i>I rode with
the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.548
Stand by, guys.
We're going in five.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.940
Lancer's boys are here!

01:28:00.065 --> 01:28:02.109
The old man here?

01:28:02.234 --> 01:28:03.819
Nada.

01:28:03.944 --> 01:28:05.404
But the son is.

01:28:07.531 --> 01:28:09.491
Ah. Heh, heh.

01:28:09.616 --> 01:28:11.076
The one from Boston.

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.203
I don't know.

01:28:14.246 --> 01:28:15.622
You from Boston?

01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:16.790
Yes.

01:28:16.915 --> 01:28:18.375
It's the Boston one!

01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:22.004
Keep the others outside.

01:28:23.213 --> 01:28:24.548
Let the brother come in.

01:28:26.216 --> 01:28:27.926
You heard him, Boston.

01:28:36.894 --> 01:28:38.729
Come on in, Boston.

01:28:40.022 --> 01:28:41.440
See, honey?

01:28:41.565 --> 01:28:43.776
I told you they'd come
to parlay.

01:28:45.402 --> 01:28:46.653
You all right,
honey?

01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:49.782
Oh, she's just fine.

01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:51.575
Ain't you, shorty?

01:28:52.785 --> 01:28:54.745
I'm fine, Scott.

01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:56.622
They haven't hurt you?

01:28:56.747 --> 01:28:58.832
Not yet, I ain't.

01:28:58.957 --> 01:29:00.751
But that can all change...

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:02.795
like that.

01:29:06.632 --> 01:29:08.092
Say...

01:29:08.258 --> 01:29:09.927
where'd you get that limp?

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:12.680
- From the war.
- Mm.

01:29:13.972 --> 01:29:15.599
Which side?

01:29:15.724 --> 01:29:18.936
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

01:29:19.061 --> 01:29:20.604
Mm.

01:29:20.771 --> 01:29:23.273
What'd they call that outfit?

01:29:23.399 --> 01:29:24.775
Bengal Lancers.

01:29:28.737 --> 01:29:30.781
Now, now, now,
that is funny.

01:29:30.906 --> 01:29:33.325
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:34.702
Don't you get it?

01:29:34.827 --> 01:29:36.704
"Bengal Lancer"?

01:29:36.829 --> 01:29:38.163
Hm?

01:29:38.288 --> 01:29:39.623
Oh, yeah.

01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:41.375
I get it now.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.586
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:48.090
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

01:29:48.215 --> 01:29:50.676
So is blowing the heads
off little girls.

01:29:52.219 --> 01:29:55.222
But they can only hang me
once, right?

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.307
So...

01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:00.519
you come down here for a...

01:30:00.644 --> 01:30:02.896
For a Boston social?

01:30:03.022 --> 01:30:05.649
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

01:30:05.816 --> 01:30:09.778
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

01:30:09.903 --> 01:30:13.365
a whole lot of chicken mole
in Mexico.

01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:14.908
That's a lot of money.

01:30:15.034 --> 01:30:17.369
Well, she's a lot
of little girl.

01:30:17.494 --> 01:30:19.288
Or don't you agree?

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:20.706
I agree.

01:30:22.666 --> 01:30:24.335
So, what's next?

01:30:24.501 --> 01:30:26.837
Well, I'll send one of my boys
out to your ranch

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:29.256
to fill you in
on all the details, but, uh...

01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:34.970
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this:

01:30:36.347 --> 01:30:39.266
I don't want
no beaner bronco buster

01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:41.018
handing me that $50,000.

01:30:41.143 --> 01:30:44.271
I want the old man himself.

01:30:44.396 --> 01:30:49.943
Murdoch Lancer
puts $50,000 in my lap...

01:30:50.069 --> 01:30:53.238
or I heave this little pitcher
down a well!

01:30:53.364 --> 01:30:55.866
You got that, Boston?

01:30:56.033 --> 01:30:57.743
Huh?

01:30:57.868 --> 01:30:59.286
Yeah.

01:30:59.411 --> 01:31:01.705
All right, messenger boy.

01:31:03.207 --> 01:31:04.750
Deliver my message.

01:31:11.548 --> 01:31:14.968
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:16.887
Settle into it.

01:31:17.054 --> 01:31:19.056
Enjoy it.

01:31:19.181 --> 01:31:20.265
And cut!

01:31:22.935 --> 01:31:24.103
Oh, boy.

01:31:24.228 --> 01:31:25.813
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella,

01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:28.273
- with that throw, did I?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:29.900
I got pads on.

01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:32.069
And I throw myself on the floor

01:31:32.194 --> 01:31:35.155
just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.573
The gate's clean.

01:31:36.699 --> 01:31:39.076
Rick, Rick, Rick.

01:31:39.243 --> 01:31:40.786
Put her there.

01:31:40.911 --> 01:31:42.037
- That was it.
- Really?

01:31:42.162 --> 01:31:43.580
That was absolutely fantastic.

01:31:43.747 --> 01:31:44.999
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:47.001
Your idea about
throwing the little girl

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:48.919
on the ground
just worked like a charm.

01:31:49.086 --> 01:31:51.046
I figured you said Shakespeare,
so... Yeah.

01:31:51.171 --> 01:31:52.256
That's right. That was...

01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:54.466
That's what I mean
by "scare me."

01:31:54.591 --> 01:31:56.969
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:59.513
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

01:31:59.638 --> 01:32:01.724
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:03.392
Where the hell
did that come from?

01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:05.644
- I don't know. Improv.
- That was wonderful.

01:32:05.769 --> 01:32:09.189
It was just... That was
a triple alliterative improv.

01:32:09.314 --> 01:32:10.816
You don't hear those
too often.

01:32:10.941 --> 01:32:12.776
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't...?

01:32:12.943 --> 01:32:14.486
- Don't need to go again?
- We're done.

01:32:14.611 --> 01:32:15.946
- That was fantastic.
- All right.

01:32:16.113 --> 01:32:17.948
Okay, moving on.
We're in the bordello.

01:32:18.115 --> 01:32:19.491
Next setup!

01:32:23.287 --> 01:32:27.041
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.376
Thank you.

01:32:29.501 --> 01:32:30.669
Heh.

01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:49.313
Rick fucking Dalton.

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:03.869
That's a car.

01:33:05.162 --> 01:33:06.664
That's a strange car.

01:33:07.998 --> 01:33:10.334
Snake, go see
who's outside.

01:33:22.846 --> 01:33:24.223
So who is it?

01:33:24.348 --> 01:33:26.183
I ain't for sure yet.

01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:28.519
It's a bitchen yellow
Coupe de Ville.

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:30.771
Keep an eye on him.

01:34:19.611 --> 01:34:21.155
Come on.

01:34:37.755 --> 01:34:39.506
Where the hell
is everybody?

01:34:48.807 --> 01:34:50.267
Hey, where's Gypsy?

01:34:50.392 --> 01:34:52.102
She's down
by the chop shop.

01:34:58.942 --> 01:35:01.028
- Hey!
- Hello!

01:35:01.153 --> 01:35:04.198
Gypsy! I want you
to come meet my new friend.

01:35:04.323 --> 01:35:06.617
Some old-looking
dude in a Hawaiian shirt

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:08.452
who just gave Pussycat
a ride home.

01:35:08.577 --> 01:35:10.162
He just gave her a lift?

01:35:10.287 --> 01:35:12.289
Nope. She's bringing him

01:35:12.456 --> 01:35:14.291
down the ranch
to meet everybody.

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:17.002
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:21.465
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

01:35:21.632 --> 01:35:24.051
Thank you for giving
our precious Pussy a ride home.

01:35:24.176 --> 01:35:25.386
Think nothing of it.

01:35:25.511 --> 01:35:26.887
We love Pussy.

01:35:27.012 --> 01:35:28.514
Yes, we do.

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:30.808
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:33.477
Everybody left
for Santa Barbara.

01:35:33.602 --> 01:35:35.062
Really?

01:35:35.187 --> 01:35:37.189
Charlie's gone?
Everybody left?

01:35:37.314 --> 01:35:40.317
Well, not "everybody" everybody,
but mostly everybody.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.196
Drag.

01:35:45.614 --> 01:35:48.200
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:50.619
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig you.

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:53.038
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

01:35:53.163 --> 01:35:55.624
Yeah, you got to come back.

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:57.710
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:02.548
So how's it all
comparing to your glory days?

01:36:02.673 --> 01:36:04.258
Well, things have changed.

01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:09.555
Not a bad mount, Connie.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.016
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

01:36:12.182 --> 01:36:14.184
- Is that right?
- Every day?

01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:16.228
Well, every week.

01:36:16.353 --> 01:36:17.938
All right.

01:36:18.063 --> 01:36:19.773
Ain't she just darling?

01:36:23.402 --> 01:36:26.572
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

01:36:26.697 --> 01:36:28.490
This is Tex.

01:36:28.615 --> 01:36:30.868
We're gonna be leading you
on a great trail ride

01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:33.370
through the beautiful
Santa Susana canyons.

01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:36.707
Now, Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.126
- Yes.
- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

01:36:39.251 --> 01:36:41.253
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex? Come here.

01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:43.881
So, uh, if you're both
experienced riders,

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:47.176
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.552
You ready to have some fun?

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:51.430
So Pussycat brought back
some guy with her.

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:53.557
Gypsy wants you
to go give him a look-see.

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:55.225
Yeah. Sure thing.

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:17.081
Oh, and here's someone
you absolutely have to meet.

01:37:17.206 --> 01:37:19.500
One of our most favorite sons.

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:22.252
Tex, come on over here
and say hi to Cliff.

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:24.505
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:28.133
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

01:37:28.258 --> 01:37:29.134
Copeville.

01:37:29.259 --> 01:37:31.470
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:33.097
Course I have.

01:37:33.222 --> 01:37:35.683
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.434
In August, no less.

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:39.978
That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:43.023
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:48.362
Man...

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:52.116
Charlie's gonna dig you.

01:37:52.282 --> 01:37:54.535
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.079
Everybody's talking
all friendly.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:59.748
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

01:37:59.873 --> 01:38:03.043
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:05.462
If he comes this
way, let me know.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.718
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:13.387
Yeah, George
still owns it.

01:38:13.512 --> 01:38:15.931
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:18.934
Does he still live
right there?

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.019
Yeah.

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:21.437
Is he here now?

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.147
I guess so.

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:27.776
So George gave you all
permission to be here?

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:30.154
Course he did.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.864
And y'all take care of him?

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:35.159
Oh, we take care
of George.

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:36.410
We love George.

01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:40.205
Well,
is there anything wrong

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.499
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:44.418
You can't see him
right now.

01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:46.795
Why can't I see him
right now?

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.049
Because
he's napping.

01:38:51.842 --> 01:38:53.844
This is his nap time.

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:05.939
Well, I think I'll just
go see for myself.

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:09.109
You never know.

01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:10.903
He might have just woke up.

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:22.623
The old Hawaiian
guy's coming this way.

01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:25.459
Okay, y'all, beat it.

01:39:25.584 --> 01:39:26.919
I'll handle this guy.

01:39:31.048 --> 01:39:32.049
Fine.

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.179
You the mama bear?

01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:23.058
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:26.145
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:27.646
That's very nice of you,

01:40:27.771 --> 01:40:29.606
but you picked
the wrong time.

01:40:29.773 --> 01:40:31.734
George is taking a nap
right now.

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:33.736
Oh, that is unfortunate.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.112
Yes, it is.

01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:38.907
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.409
How do you know George?

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.911
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:45.289
When was the last time
you saw George?

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:48.625
Oh, I'd say about...

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:50.878
eight years ago.

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:53.964
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:56.258
I didn't realize the two of you
were so close.

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:58.093
When he wakes up,

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.304
I'll let him know you came by.

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:02.973
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now

01:41:03.098 --> 01:41:04.308
while I'm here.

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:05.976
Came a long ways.

01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:08.812
Don't know when I'll get back
this way again.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:12.399
Oh, I understand, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

01:41:12.524 --> 01:41:14.151
Impossible?

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.028
Why is that impossible?

01:41:16.153 --> 01:41:18.405
Me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday night...

01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:20.658
<i>F.B.I. and Bonanza.
but George finds it hard</i>

01:41:20.824 --> 01:41:22.242
to keep awake,
so I make him nap

01:41:22.368 --> 01:41:24.495
so I don't get gypped out
of my TV time.

01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:25.871
Ah.

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:31.251
Well, look, Red,
I'm coming in there.

01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:35.381
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna
get a good look at George.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.341
And this...

01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:41.011
ain't stopping me.

01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:45.349
Okay.

01:41:46.558 --> 01:41:48.102
Suit yourself.

01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:15.814
He back there?

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:19.109
Door at the end
of the hallway.

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:21.945
You might have to
shake him awake.

01:43:22.112 --> 01:43:23.822
I fucked his brains out
this morning.

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:31.121
He may be tired.

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.343
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:47.638
George is blind,

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:50.307
so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:17.251
George, you awake?

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:36.937
George?

01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:40.274
George?

01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:45.237
George?

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.617
- George!
- Jesus.

01:44:50.743 --> 01:44:53.245
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:55.414
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:58.625
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Uh... Who are you?

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:00.627
It's Cliff Booth.

01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:03.839
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.424
John Wilkes Booth?

01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:06.925
No, Cliff Booth.

01:45:09.219 --> 01:45:10.471
Who's that?

01:45:10.596 --> 01:45:13.140
<i>I used to shoot
Bounty Law here, George.</i>

01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:15.225
I was Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:18.145
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.813
The Dalton Brothers?

01:45:19.938 --> 01:45:21.565
No, Rick Dalton.

01:45:23.067 --> 01:45:24.234
Who's that?

01:45:24.401 --> 01:45:27.154
<i>He was the star
of Bounty Law.</i>

01:45:27.279 --> 01:45:28.947
And who are you?

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:30.741
I was Rick's stunt double.

01:45:31.909 --> 01:45:33.786
Rick who?

01:45:33.911 --> 01:45:35.621
It don't matter, George.

01:45:35.746 --> 01:45:38.791
We were colleagues
from the past, and I just wanted

01:45:38.916 --> 01:45:40.751
to make sure
you're doing okay.

01:45:40.918 --> 01:45:43.170
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:44.963
Can't see shit.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:46.840
Would you call that
"the matter"?

01:45:46.965 --> 01:45:48.676
The man can't see shit,
okay?

01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:51.261
I know. I'm sorry about that.
I was told.

01:45:51.387 --> 01:45:53.931
Squeaky
sent me to bed.

01:45:54.098 --> 01:45:56.308
Would that be
the little redhead out front?

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:01.772
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

01:46:01.897 --> 01:46:03.315
First you wake me up,

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.818
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:07.986
I was fucking blind!

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.156
How am I gonna know
what the hell color the head

01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:13.993
of the girl is that's with me
all the time?

01:46:14.118 --> 01:46:15.911
Oh, fair enough, George.

01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:22.710
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

01:46:22.835 --> 01:46:25.337
Everyone
don't need a stuntman.

01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.389
I don't know who you are...

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:39.059
but you touched me today.

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:43.564
You came to visit me.

01:46:43.689 --> 01:46:45.733
Now I got to go back to sleep.

01:46:48.318 --> 01:46:50.946
<i>I got to watch
F.B.I. tonight.</i>

01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:52.573
I watch it with Squeaky.

01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:57.494
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:00.456
What happens when she
gets pissed off, George?

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:02.833
Nothing.

01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:06.837
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:15.429
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

01:47:21.018 --> 01:47:23.395
Just who the fuck are you?

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.397
I'm Cliff Booth.

01:47:25.522 --> 01:47:26.732
I'm a stuntman.

01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:29.026
We used to work together,
George.

01:47:29.193 --> 01:47:31.862
And I just want
to make sure you're okay.

01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:35.699
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:38.535
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:40.954
She loves me.

01:47:43.165 --> 01:47:45.250
So suck on that.

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:55.386
You take care, George.

01:48:02.226 --> 01:48:03.894
Goddamn it.

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:26.792
You embarrassed me.

01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:30.129
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:34.341
How'd your little talk
with George go?

01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:35.467
Are we kidnapping him?

01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:37.344
Not the word I'd use.

01:48:37.469 --> 01:48:39.680
Now you've talked to him, you
believe everything's all right?

01:48:39.805 --> 01:48:41.640
Not exactly.

01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:43.684
This was a mistake.
You should leave.

01:48:43.809 --> 01:48:45.561
Way ahead of you.

01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:51.817
George isn't blind!

01:48:51.942 --> 01:48:53.527
You're the blind one!

01:49:38.364 --> 01:49:40.032
You do that?

01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:47.164
You know, that's not my car.

01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:49.375
That's my boss's car.

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.835
And if something were to happen
to my boss's car,

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.379
well, I'd get in trouble.

01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:13.107
Fix it.

01:50:13.232 --> 01:50:15.401
Fuck you.

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:43.846
- Leave him alone!
- He's a flower!

01:50:43.971 --> 01:50:45.514
He's a flower, man.

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:47.975
He's just a flower.
He doesn't know better.

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.893
Ladies.

01:50:55.941 --> 01:50:58.986
Come one step closer
and I will knock his teeth out.

01:51:10.414 --> 01:51:12.041
Fix it.

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:14.418
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

01:51:14.585 --> 01:51:16.045
Nope.

01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:17.838
Tire first.

01:51:27.806 --> 01:51:29.850
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:33.479
Get on a horse, go get Tex
and get his ass down here.

01:51:33.604 --> 01:51:34.521
Okay.

01:51:43.822 --> 01:51:45.532
<i>I love you.</i>

01:52:09.932 --> 01:52:12.351
Tex! Tex!

01:52:12.476 --> 01:52:14.186
That Hawaiian guy's
back at the ranch

01:52:14.311 --> 01:52:15.479
kicking Clem's face in.

01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:17.398
Ah, son of a...

01:52:17.523 --> 01:52:18.982
I'll take over for Tex.

01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:20.818
Right this way.

01:52:47.428 --> 01:52:49.263
Hyah! Hyah!

01:53:11.035 --> 01:53:12.703
Clem, you all right?

01:53:33.932 --> 01:53:35.559
How do?

01:53:35.726 --> 01:53:38.979
What a day.
Shit, I almost lost my shit.

01:54:27.111 --> 01:54:28.278
You, uh...

01:54:28.445 --> 01:54:30.489
<i>You want to come in
and watch my F.B.I.?</i>

01:54:30.614 --> 01:54:33.409
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

01:54:33.534 --> 01:54:34.785
Thought we'd order a pizza.

01:54:34.952 --> 01:54:36.161
All right.

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:37.579
All right.

01:54:58.726 --> 01:55:01.228
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton,
Willard.</i>

01:55:01.353 --> 01:55:03.522
<i>Any kind of luck,
we'll be unloaded</i>

01:55:03.647 --> 01:55:06.150
<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

01:55:10.988 --> 01:55:14.742
Hey, bought me
an acid-dipped cigarette today.

01:55:14.867 --> 01:55:16.160
Oh, yeah?

01:55:16.327 --> 01:55:18.329
You want to buy
a cigarette dipped in acid?

01:55:18.495 --> 01:55:19.997
Yeah.

01:55:20.164 --> 01:55:22.166
If I'm gonna trip,
I want to trip here, man.

01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:24.376
Walk in the woods.
Not in my home.

01:55:26.337 --> 01:55:27.504
Just gonna stash it here.

01:55:27.671 --> 01:55:29.757
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

01:55:29.882 --> 01:55:32.718
You want to smoke some,
smoke some. Just save me some.

01:55:32.843 --> 01:55:36.096
Nah, I don't need
to trip out on no acid.

01:55:36.221 --> 01:55:38.057
My booze don't need no buddy.

01:55:38.182 --> 01:55:39.391
Whoa! Oh!

01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:41.352
Here I come. Here I come.

01:55:43.395 --> 01:55:44.605
Mm.

01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:46.774
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

01:55:46.899 --> 01:55:48.442
<i>There's a truck tailing us,
sir.</i>

01:55:51.695 --> 01:55:54.198
<i>It might be a farmer
in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

<i>Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.</i>

01:59:12.813 --> 01:59:15.190

All right. Take it easy.

<i>He loved the food
so much that during his stay,</i>

01:59:35.002 --> 01:59:36.837
<i>Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.</i>

01:59:36.962 --> 01:59:39.840
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

01:59:39.965 --> 01:59:41.633
<i>In fact,
he thought the post-synced,</i>

01:59:41.759 --> 01:59:43.635

02:01:54.933 --> 02:01:58.228
<i>However,
as the two men return home,</i>

02:01:58.354 --> 02:01:59.938
<i>they've come
to an understanding.</i>

02:02:00.064 --> 02:02:01.398
Well, here it goes now.

02:02:02.941 --> 02:02:03.901
With the, uh...

02:02:05.402 --> 02:02:06.945
With the new wife, I, uh...

02:02:08.405 --> 02:02:11.408
I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

02:02:11.575 --> 02:02:14.912
You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

02:02:15.079 --> 02:02:17.748
So I think the plan
is to sell the house

02:02:17.873 --> 02:02:21.627
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

02:02:21.752 --> 02:02:24.421
You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

02:02:24.546 --> 02:02:27.424
Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

02:02:27.549 --> 02:02:28.676
That's a good plan.

02:02:28.801 --> 02:02:30.844
Yeah. You know,

02:02:30.969 --> 02:02:33.347
by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

02:02:33.472 --> 02:02:37.476
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

02:02:37.601 --> 02:02:41.855
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:45.275
So when this whole
European journey is over,

02:02:45.401 --> 02:02:46.443
I think we've, uh...

02:02:48.112 --> 02:02:50.531
We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

02:03:01.667 --> 02:03:03.669
<i>So these last
four Italian flicks,</i>

02:03:03.794 --> 02:03:05.254

02:03:08.632 --> 02:03:11.301
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.</i>

02:03:11.468 --> 02:03:13.554
<i>The only thing the two men
know of for sure:</i>

02:03:13.679 --> 02:03:15.389
<i>Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have</i>

02:03:15.514 --> 02:03:17.349
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

02:03:17.474 --> 02:03:20.519
<i>Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

02:03:20.644 --> 02:03:22.938
<i>it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.</i>

02:03:23.063 --> 02:03:25.566
<i>And when you come to the end
of the line with a buddy</i>

02:03:25.691 --> 02:03:28.402
<i>who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

02:03:28.527 --> 02:03:29.945
<i>getting blind drunk together</i>

02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:32.656

02:08:40.297 --> 02:08:42.383
I don't want to party anymore.
I am tired.

02:08:42.508 --> 02:08:44.301
Because he got it done.

02:08:44.468 --> 02:08:46.970
No, it's not... It's not
because he just got it done.

02:08:47.137 --> 02:08:48.347
He had just as much time

02:08:48.472 --> 02:08:50.391
as all the rest
of the goddamn directors.

02:08:50.516 --> 02:08:52.643
What he did with that time...
That's what counted.

02:08:52.768 --> 02:08:55.479
<i>At Casa Vega,
Rick and Cliff drank so much that,</i>

02:08:55.604 --> 02:08:57.815
<i>when they left,
they left the Cadillac there</i>

02:08:57.982 --> 02:08:58.857
<i>and took a cab home.</i>

02:08:58.983 --> 02:09:00.734
The greatest action director,

02:09:00.859 --> 02:09:03.237
underrated guy of all time.

02:09:03.362 --> 02:09:06.240
<i>Around 10,
Sharon and her friends</i>

02:09:06.365 --> 02:09:08.993
<i>left El Coyote
and arrived back at her house.</i>

02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:21.046
You've had,
like, 19 margaritas.

02:09:23.090 --> 02:09:25.050
<i>The four of them
hung out a little longer,</i>

02:09:25.175 --> 02:09:27.386
<i>with Abigail even playing
the piano for them...</i>

<i>until she
returned to her room,</i>

02:10:06.008 --> 02:10:07.634
<i>smoked a joint
and read a book.</i>

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.219
<i>That was around 11.</i>

02:10:28.405 --> 02:10:30.240
<i>At more or less the same time,</i>

02:10:30.407 --> 02:10:33.243
<i>Voytek laid on the couch
watching American television</i>

02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:35.245
<i>and thought about
how much better it was</i>

02:10:35.371 --> 02:10:37.915
<i>than Polish television,
as he smoked a big joint.</i>

02:10:39.583 --> 02:10:41.085
<i>Somewhere around 11:10,</i>

02:10:41.251 --> 02:10:43.462
<i>Sharon changed
into her comfy house attire.</i>

02:10:43.587 --> 02:10:45.464
Feel better?

02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:47.925
That is drastically better.

02:10:49.593 --> 02:10:51.679
<i>It was after 11:45 by the time</i>

02:10:51.804 --> 02:10:53.972
<i>the yellow cab
dropped Rick and Cliff</i>

02:10:54.098 --> 02:10:55.766
<i>in front of the house.</i>

02:10:55.891 --> 02:10:57.101
Thank you. Right here.

02:10:57.267 --> 02:10:58.769
<i>All right. Grazie, amigo.</i>

02:11:00.562 --> 02:11:02.940
- How much do I owe you?
- Three dollars.

02:11:03.065 --> 02:11:05.109
<i>Brandy was
glad to see them return.</i>

02:11:05.234 --> 02:11:06.777
- Thank you, brother.
- Thanks.

02:11:07.945 --> 02:11:09.279
More margaritas.

02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:16.203
<i>Around midnight,</i>

02:11:16.328 --> 02:11:18.539
<i>a completely drunk
Rick Dalton started making</i>

02:11:18.664 --> 02:11:20.874
<i>a blender of frozen margaritas.</i>

02:11:23.293 --> 02:11:24.628
All right.

02:11:26.463 --> 02:11:28.507
<i>- We're walking.
- At the same time,</i>

02:11:28.632 --> 02:11:29.967
<i>Cliff was attaching a leash</i>

02:11:30.134 --> 02:11:31.802
<i>to an excited
Brandy's dog collar.</i>

02:11:31.969 --> 02:11:32.845
I know.

02:11:38.475 --> 02:11:40.477
I remember you.

02:11:40.644 --> 02:11:41.979
A cigarette dipped in acid.

02:11:42.146 --> 02:11:44.315
- What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.

02:11:44.481 --> 02:11:46.442
- How much?
- Fifty cents.

02:11:48.485 --> 02:11:49.528
Fifty cents.

02:11:49.653 --> 02:11:52.072
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

02:11:55.492 --> 02:11:56.785
Tonight the night?

02:11:58.329 --> 02:11:59.955
Why not?

02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:25.397
And away we go.

02:12:27.566 --> 02:12:31.862
Our Polish friend said it was
the hottest day of the year.

02:12:31.987 --> 02:12:33.864
Despite the
fact that he said it,

02:12:33.989 --> 02:12:36.200
actually, it might be true.

02:13:56.947 --> 02:13:57.906
Goddamn.

02:13:59.116 --> 02:14:01.035
Fucking private road.

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.662
Damn property taxes
up the butt.

02:14:03.787 --> 02:14:04.997
Goddamn.

02:14:12.463 --> 02:14:15.966
Bunch of goddamn
fucking hippies.

02:14:16.133 --> 02:14:18.469
What the fuck?

02:14:21.597 --> 02:14:22.681
Hey, you!

02:14:24.266 --> 02:14:28.187
Yeah, asshole,
I'm talking to you!

02:14:28.312 --> 02:14:30.147
What the hell
do you think you're doing

02:14:30.272 --> 02:14:33.651
bringing that noisy hunk of shit
around here at midnight?

02:14:33.817 --> 02:14:36.487
This is a private road,
all right?

02:14:36.612 --> 02:14:39.156
Who are you?
And who are you here to see?

02:14:39.281 --> 02:14:41.992
Nobody, sir. We just got lost
and a little turned around.

02:14:42.117 --> 02:14:43.577
Ah, horseshit.

02:14:45.954 --> 02:14:47.706
You fucking hippies
came up here

02:14:47.831 --> 02:14:49.750
to smoke dope
on a dark road, huh?

02:14:49.875 --> 02:14:52.586
Next time you want to try that,
fix your fucking muffler.

02:14:52.711 --> 02:14:54.672
Look, we're really sorry
we disturbed you.

02:14:54.838 --> 02:14:56.757
Look, chief,
you don't belong here.

02:14:56.882 --> 02:14:58.884
Now, take this
mechanical asshole

02:14:59.009 --> 02:15:02.346
and get it
off my fucking street!

02:15:14.233 --> 02:15:15.693
Hey!

02:15:15.859 --> 02:15:18.529
Dennis Hopper!
Move this fucking piece of shit!

02:15:18.696 --> 02:15:21.031
All right. Just give me a moment
to turn it around.

02:15:21.198 --> 02:15:22.908
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

02:15:23.033 --> 02:15:24.952
but fucking drive it,
and drive it now!

02:15:25.077 --> 02:15:26.662
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

02:15:26.787 --> 02:15:28.330
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

02:15:32.209 --> 02:15:35.879
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

02:15:36.046 --> 02:15:39.883
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

02:15:45.597 --> 02:15:47.057
Dirty fucking hippies.

02:16:00.070 --> 02:16:01.739
There in his
fancy fucking house,

02:16:01.905 --> 02:16:03.532
thinking he's handled it.

02:16:03.657 --> 02:16:06.243
But he's seen us.
He's awake. He's alert.

02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:09.621
They're all awake. They're
listening to fucking records.

02:16:09.747 --> 02:16:11.165
Everybody's fucking awake!

02:16:11.290 --> 02:16:12.416
Look!

02:16:12.583 --> 02:16:15.044
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

02:16:15.169 --> 02:16:19.214
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:23.010
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

02:16:23.135 --> 02:16:26.138
Now, he either said that,

02:16:26.263 --> 02:16:28.015
or I'm a liar.

02:16:29.475 --> 02:16:32.603
Now, are any one of you
calling me a liar?

02:16:33.646 --> 02:16:35.189
Hm?

02:16:35.314 --> 02:16:37.149
How about you?

02:16:37.274 --> 02:16:38.776
Are you calling me a liar?

02:16:40.277 --> 02:16:42.279
No, of course not.

02:16:42.446 --> 02:16:43.280
Good.

02:16:43.447 --> 02:16:44.782
Hold it.

02:16:44.948 --> 02:16:47.368
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

02:16:47.493 --> 02:16:48.702
<i>The guy from Bounty Law.</i>

02:16:48.827 --> 02:16:50.537
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

02:16:50.663 --> 02:16:53.624
That guy in the robe
was Jake Cahill.

02:16:53.749 --> 02:16:55.959
Wait a minute.
That was fucking Jake Cahill

02:16:56.126 --> 02:16:57.544
that just yelled at me?

02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:59.463
He was older,
but, yeah, I think so.

02:16:59.588 --> 02:17:00.673
So who's this Rick guy?

02:17:00.798 --> 02:17:02.633
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together.

02:17:02.758 --> 02:17:04.968
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill
on a cowboy show

02:17:05.094 --> 02:17:06.470
<i>in the '50s called
Bounty Law.</i>

02:17:06.595 --> 02:17:07.888
Fuck you, Katie.

02:17:08.013 --> 02:17:09.390
Sorry I don't know
the name

02:17:09.515 --> 02:17:11.308
of every fascist on TV
in the '50s.

02:17:11.433 --> 02:17:15.854
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:18.732
<i>When I was a kid,
I had a Bounty Law lunch box.</i>

02:17:18.857 --> 02:17:21.151
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

02:17:22.486 --> 02:17:25.197
Dig this!

02:17:25.322 --> 02:17:27.199
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

02:17:27.324 --> 02:17:29.868
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

02:17:29.994 --> 02:17:31.495
All right, dig it.

02:17:31.662 --> 02:17:35.124
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

02:17:35.249 --> 02:17:36.792
And if you grew up watching TV,

02:17:36.917 --> 02:17:38.794
that means you grew up
watching murder.

02:17:38.919 --> 02:17:39.795
Mm-hm.

02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:41.547
Every show on TV

02:17:41.672 --> 02:17:44.425
<i>that wasn't I Love Lucy
was about murder.</i>

02:17:44.550 --> 02:17:47.594
So my idea is...

02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:50.097
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

02:17:52.182 --> 02:17:53.726
I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

02:17:53.851 --> 02:17:56.270
We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

02:17:56.395 --> 02:17:58.188
The people
an entire generation grew up

02:17:58.355 --> 02:17:59.982
watching kill people
live here.

02:18:00.107 --> 02:18:02.067
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

02:18:02.192 --> 02:18:03.694
I say fuck them.

02:18:03.861 --> 02:18:06.280
I say we cut their cocks off
and make them eat it.

02:18:06.405 --> 02:18:08.574
That's a great idea, Sadie.

02:18:11.035 --> 02:18:12.745
You two ready
to kill some piggies?

02:18:22.212 --> 02:18:24.423
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

02:18:24.548 --> 02:18:26.925
Sorry, I forgot my knife
in the car.

02:18:27.051 --> 02:18:28.886
Can I go...?
Can I go back and get it?

02:18:30.012 --> 02:18:31.263
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

02:18:31.388 --> 02:18:33.390
- Go on. Wait a minute.
- What?

02:18:33.515 --> 02:18:35.601
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

02:18:38.687 --> 02:18:39.813
Oh.

02:18:39.938 --> 02:18:41.774
Right. Thank you.

02:18:41.899 --> 02:18:44.568
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

02:18:44.693 --> 02:18:47.655
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

02:18:57.956 --> 02:18:59.583
Oh, that fucking bitch!

02:18:59.750 --> 02:19:00.834
Shh! Calm down.

02:19:00.959 --> 02:19:02.628
There's a fucking house
right there.

02:19:03.921 --> 02:19:04.922
What do we do now?

02:19:05.089 --> 02:19:06.507
We do what we came to do.

02:19:06.632 --> 02:19:09.426
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

02:19:09.551 --> 02:19:10.761
Any more questions?

02:19:10.886 --> 02:19:12.096
Hm?

02:19:14.056 --> 02:19:16.809
Okay, pig killers,
let's kill some piggies.

02:19:16.934 --> 02:19:18.143
All right.

02:19:30.864 --> 02:19:32.658
Oh, someone's hungry.

02:19:41.458 --> 02:19:42.543
All right.

02:19:44.461 --> 02:19:46.338
It's feeding time.

02:19:49.341 --> 02:19:50.509
Brandy, couch.

02:19:57.141 --> 02:19:58.517
And don't you mo...

02:20:06.984 --> 02:20:08.944
Oh, man.

02:20:11.655 --> 02:20:12.573
Uh...

02:20:18.037 --> 02:20:20.080
The train
has left the station.

02:20:27.004 --> 02:20:28.255
Bad idea.

02:21:28.899 --> 02:21:30.401
Whoa.

02:22:17.781 --> 02:22:20.909
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

02:22:21.035 --> 02:22:22.870
All right? Go.

02:23:09.875 --> 02:23:11.168
Hey.

02:23:14.213 --> 02:23:18.258
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

02:23:18.384 --> 02:23:20.552
Now, I do not want
to get into it tonight.

02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:32.731
Uh... can I help you?

02:23:39.113 --> 02:23:40.155
Shit.

02:23:41.532 --> 02:23:43.367
How many other people
are here?

02:23:43.534 --> 02:23:46.286
Oh, just the one sleeping
in the back there.

02:23:47.871 --> 02:23:50.624
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

02:23:50.749 --> 02:23:51.875
What if he says no?

02:23:52.042 --> 02:23:53.502
Don't take no for an answer.

02:23:53.627 --> 02:23:56.171
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

02:23:58.465 --> 02:23:59.967
Hey.

02:24:05.389 --> 02:24:07.182
You are real, right?

02:24:07.308 --> 02:24:09.935
I'm as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:21.238
What the fuck?

02:24:28.162 --> 02:24:29.455
Go to the living room.

02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.248
What is going on, huh?

02:24:36.337 --> 02:24:38.047
<i>- Go!
- Okay. Si, si.</i>

02:24:40.424 --> 02:24:41.759
Who the fuck's that?

02:24:41.925 --> 02:24:42.801
I don't know.

02:24:44.219 --> 02:24:45.137
Francesca.

02:24:51.935 --> 02:24:54.605
Oh. Uh...

02:24:54.772 --> 02:24:56.482
What...?

02:24:56.607 --> 02:24:58.317
Oh, I know you.

02:24:58.442 --> 02:25:00.194
I know all three of you.

02:25:01.487 --> 02:25:04.031
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

02:25:04.156 --> 02:25:06.825
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

02:25:08.452 --> 02:25:12.289
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

02:25:12.456 --> 02:25:15.959
And you, I remember
your white little face.

02:25:16.085 --> 02:25:17.961
And you were on a horsie.

02:25:18.128 --> 02:25:19.838
Yeah.

02:25:19.963 --> 02:25:23.050
Uh... You are...?

02:25:23.175 --> 02:25:25.010
I'm the devil,

02:25:25.135 --> 02:25:28.472
and I'm here to do
the devil's business.

02:25:31.183 --> 02:25:34.812
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

02:25:34.979 --> 02:25:36.981
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

02:25:40.484 --> 02:25:41.568
Fuck!

02:25:56.667 --> 02:25:58.085
Son of a bitch!

02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:37.458
Hey, you.

02:26:40.544 --> 02:26:42.671
How dare you come into my house,
motherfucker!

02:27:08.739 --> 02:27:10.407
Wow, man.

02:28:03.627 --> 02:28:04.712
What the fuck?

02:28:06.213 --> 02:28:07.756
Jesus Christ.

02:29:24.541 --> 02:29:25.918
Holy shit.

02:29:29.004 --> 02:29:31.799
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

02:29:51.068 --> 02:29:53.028
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

02:29:53.153 --> 02:29:56.365
Around what time was it
when you confronted the intruder?

02:29:56.490 --> 02:29:58.325
It was about midnight.

02:29:58.450 --> 02:29:59.576
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

02:29:59.743 --> 02:30:01.286
How do you know
it was midnight?

02:30:01.412 --> 02:30:04.665
Well, I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen.

02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:08.002
You know, I was
making margaritas, and, uh...

02:30:08.127 --> 02:30:09.837
I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler.

02:30:09.962 --> 02:30:11.630
I looked up at the clock.

02:30:11.755 --> 02:30:13.757
It said... The kitchen clock
said midnight.

02:30:13.924 --> 02:30:15.426
Twelve o'clock exactly?

02:30:15.592 --> 02:30:17.678
I mean,
it could have been 12:05.

02:30:17.803 --> 02:30:20.139
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

02:30:20.264 --> 02:30:22.391
until the woman attacked you
in the pool.

02:30:22.516 --> 02:30:24.435
No, no.

02:30:24.601 --> 02:30:26.645
So,
what did these perpetrators do?

02:30:26.770 --> 02:30:29.315
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:32.901
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

02:30:33.027 --> 02:30:37.323
and the guy hippie
said he was the devil.

02:30:37.448 --> 02:30:40.159
And he said, "I'm here to..."

02:30:40.284 --> 02:30:42.411
do some devil shit."

02:30:42.536 --> 02:30:45.122
Or...
That's not verbatim, but...

02:30:45.289 --> 02:30:48.042
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

02:31:02.181 --> 02:31:04.224
And away we go.

02:31:07.436 --> 02:31:09.521
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

02:31:09.647 --> 02:31:11.315
What hospital you going to,
Cliff?

02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:12.650
I'll meet you there, huh?

02:31:12.816 --> 02:31:15.152
You don't want to meet me
in no hospital.

02:31:15.319 --> 02:31:17.154
Why don't you go take care
of your lady.

02:31:17.279 --> 02:31:20.157
Hey, she just took
five fucking sleeping pills.

02:31:20.282 --> 02:31:22.034
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

02:31:22.159 --> 02:31:24.662
These guys will probably
have to come out here again

02:31:24.787 --> 02:31:26.997
- just to wake her ass up.
- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

02:31:27.164 --> 02:31:28.999
I may get a limp,
but I ain't gonna die.

02:31:29.124 --> 02:31:31.043
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

02:31:31.168 --> 02:31:33.504
So no use waiting
in some waiting room.

02:31:33.671 --> 02:31:36.715
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature.

02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:38.342
Come visit me tomorrow.

02:31:38.509 --> 02:31:40.719
Bring bagels.

02:31:40.844 --> 02:31:43.222
You want to do something for me,
check on Brandy.

02:31:43.347 --> 02:31:45.182
She may be a little shook up
after that.

02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:47.685
- She may want to sleep with you.
- Are you kidding me?

02:31:47.851 --> 02:31:49.687
She's sleeping
with Francesca right now.

02:31:49.812 --> 02:31:51.689
You might never get her back.
Ha, ha.

02:31:51.855 --> 02:31:53.524
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

02:31:53.691 --> 02:31:56.026
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

02:31:59.530 --> 02:32:00.990
Hey. Hey.

02:32:04.952 --> 02:32:06.704
You're a good friend, Cliff.

02:32:08.205 --> 02:32:09.373
I try.

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:42.698
Hello?

02:32:44.658 --> 02:32:45.534
Hey.

02:32:45.659 --> 02:32:46.702
I'm Jay Sebring.

02:32:46.827 --> 02:32:48.871
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

02:32:48.996 --> 02:32:51.540
You're Rick Dalton,
right?

02:32:51.665 --> 02:32:55.210
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

02:32:55.336 --> 02:32:57.129
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

02:32:57.254 --> 02:32:59.923
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

02:33:00.049 --> 02:33:02.009
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman,

02:33:02.134 --> 02:33:03.761
she just has to go next door,
right?

02:33:05.596 --> 02:33:07.306
No shit.

02:33:07.431 --> 02:33:09.767
What the fuck happened?

02:33:09.933 --> 02:33:12.436
Oh, th-these fucking
hippie weirdos,

02:33:12.603 --> 02:33:14.813
they-they-they
broke into my house.

02:33:14.938 --> 02:33:17.608
What do you mean, like,
trying to rob you?

02:33:17.733 --> 02:33:19.526
We don't know what the fuck
they wanted.

02:33:19.652 --> 02:33:21.362
Were they robbing me?
I don't know.

02:33:21.487 --> 02:33:23.614
Were they freaking out
on some bummer trip?

02:33:23.739 --> 02:33:26.992
Who knows? But they tried
to kill my wife and my buddy.

02:33:27.117 --> 02:33:30.496
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

02:33:30.621 --> 02:33:34.291
Now, my buddy and his dog
killed two of them, and then...

02:33:34.458 --> 02:33:37.461
Well, shit.
I-I torched the last one.

02:33:37.586 --> 02:33:39.296
- "Torched"?
- Yeah.

02:33:39.463 --> 02:33:41.840
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

02:33:41.965 --> 02:33:44.843
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

02:33:44.968 --> 02:33:47.179
I got a flamethrower
in my toolshed.

02:33:47.304 --> 02:33:49.807
<i>Oh, from The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

02:33:49.974 --> 02:33:51.684
Yeah!

02:33:51.809 --> 02:33:53.310
Yeah. Yeah.

02:33:53.435 --> 02:33:54.979
That's... That's the one.

02:33:55.104 --> 02:33:58.315
Yeah, it still works too.
Thank God.

02:33:58.440 --> 02:33:59.733
Is everybody okay?

02:33:59.858 --> 02:34:02.319
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't,

02:34:02.486 --> 02:34:04.196
that's for goddamn sure.

02:34:04.321 --> 02:34:05.864
Yeah. But I'm fine.

02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:07.700
You know, my wife's fine.

02:34:07.825 --> 02:34:10.536
We're just a little shook up,
is all.

02:34:10.661 --> 02:34:14.123
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
- Yeah.

02:34:14.248 --> 02:34:16.959
<i>Jay,
honey, is everything all right?</i>

02:34:17.084 --> 02:34:19.044
Everything's okay now, honey.

02:34:19.169 --> 02:34:21.922
But some hippies
broke into the house next door.

02:34:22.047 --> 02:34:23.841
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

02:34:24.008 --> 02:34:25.843
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

02:34:26.010 --> 02:34:27.553
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

02:34:27.678 --> 02:34:31.557
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

02:34:31.682 --> 02:34:33.100
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

02:34:34.852 --> 02:34:37.229
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

02:34:37.354 --> 02:34:39.732
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

02:34:40.858 --> 02:34:42.568
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

02:34:42.693 --> 02:34:45.654
Yes, Sharon,
everybody's fine.

02:34:45.779 --> 02:34:47.906
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:34:49.450 --> 02:34:51.994
Well, yes, I am.
Thank you for asking that.

02:34:52.119 --> 02:34:54.496
<i>Rick,
would you like to come up to the house</i>

02:34:54.621 --> 02:34:57.082
<i>for a drink
and meet my other friends?</i>

02:35:03.213 --> 02:35:06.383
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:09.136
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.
I'll buzz you up.</i>

02:35:20.856 --> 02:35:21.732
Come on.

02:35:25.527 --> 02:35:27.655
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:29.239
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

02:35:29.365 --> 02:35:30.407
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

02:35:30.532 --> 02:35:31.659
Pleasure's all mine.

02:35:31.784 --> 02:35:33.577
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

02:38:52.609 --> 02:38:54.320
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

02:38:54.445 --> 02:38:56.947
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

02:38:57.114 --> 02:39:00.492
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

02:39:00.617 --> 02:39:03.746
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

02:39:03.871 --> 02:39:06.206
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

02:39:06.332 --> 02:39:08.792
been around since 1862,

02:39:08.959 --> 02:39:12.129
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

02:39:12.296 --> 02:39:15.382
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

02:39:15.507 --> 02:39:17.343
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

02:39:17.468 --> 02:39:20.387
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

02:39:20.512 --> 02:39:24.141
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

02:39:24.266 --> 02:39:26.143
with less burn on your throat

02:39:26.310 --> 02:39:28.729
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:36.403
Mm!

02:39:38.155 --> 02:39:40.699
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

02:39:40.824 --> 02:39:41.700
Hm.

02:39:41.825 --> 02:39:44.662
Better drag, more flavor,

02:39:44.828 --> 02:39:46.205
less throat burn.

02:39:48.624 --> 02:39:51.210
That's the Red Apple way.

02:39:51.335 --> 02:39:55.005
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

02:39:55.172 --> 02:39:58.717
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

02:39:58.842 --> 02:40:02.054
Take a bite
and feel all right.

02:40:02.179 --> 02:40:05.516
Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

02:40:05.641 --> 02:40:07.017
Tell them Jake sent you.

02:40:10.187 --> 02:40:11.355
And cut.

02:40:11.522 --> 02:40:13.315
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.192
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:16.777
I have a double chin.
All right?

02:40:16.902 --> 02:40:18.195
Nobody notices that crap?
